This agent would receive all available imaging data and produce a structured longitudinal imaging analysis before the debate rounds begin.",
      "rationale": "The pivotal diagnostic insight in this case \u2014 that cerebellar-predominant atrophy without basal ganglia/brainstem involvement discriminates NCL/PLA2G6 from mitochondrial encephalopathies \u2014 was not recognized until Round 2, and only after the geneticist challenged the neurologist's assumption. A dedicated neuroradiologist would have identified the progressive cerebellar atrophy pattern in Round 1 and provided the discriminative imaging analysis that proved decisive. In the clinical timeline, the failure to compare serial MRIs across institutions delayed recognition of progressive atrophy by at least 3 years. The MRI pattern was ultimately the single most discriminating piece of evidence in the case.",

This is a support agent that produces structured input for the specialist team, not a diagnostic agent.",
      "rationale": "The case record explicitly states that no single provider ever had simultaneous access to all 4 MRI scans, the EEG, the elevated lactate, and the full developmental timeline. The mother's paper binder was the only complete record. Critical findings were lost in records transfers (EEG results, genetics referral). Amendment A-003 mandates longitudinal data synthesis \u2014 this agent would be the operational mechanism for fulfilling that mandate. Without a dedicated integration function, the synthesis burden falls on specialists whose cognitive resources should be directed at diagnosis, not data assembly.",

No endocrinologist was present on the specialist panel. The neurologist, developmental pediatrician, and geneticist all provided valuable perspectives, but none had primary endocrine domain expertise. Key endocrine-specific reasoning gaps included: (1) no specialist provided nuanced analysis of whether the degree of hypercalcemia (Ca 12.4) and hypophosphatemia (Phos 1.8) falls within or outside the expected range for thyrotoxicosis-mediated effects alone \u2014 this was the central discriminating question; (2) the thyrotoxicosis treatment plan (methimazole dosing, thyroid storm risk assessment, beta-blocker optimization) was addressed in the synthesis but would have benefited from specialist-level analysis during debate rounds; (3) the PTH interpretation framework (including the equivocal range that no specialist addressed) requires endocrine expertise to properly calibrate. An endocrinologist specialist should be available for cases presenting with metabolic derangements, multi-gland pathology, or suspected endocrine syndromes.",

This case involved multi-system endocrine disease best served by an endocrinologist, geneticist, and internist. The fixed 3-specialist panel cannot optimally cover the full range of diagnostic presentations. A Case-Adaptive Specialist Selector function should be implemented as a pre-analysis step that: (1) reads the case intake data; (2) identifies the primary organ systems and diagnostic domains involved; (3) selects 3-4 specialists from an expanded roster whose domain expertise best matches the case; (4) ensures at least one specialist is selected from OUTSIDE the most obvious domain to maintain differential breadth per Article 1.3. This aligns with Article 4.3 (Team Evolution) and would prevent the mismatch of specialist expertise to case requirements seen in this case, where a developmental pediatrician was less relevant than an endocrinologist would have been.",

All three current specialists (neurologist, developmental pediatrician, geneticist) made the same factual error about the speckled ANA pattern's diagnostic significance, reflecting a shared knowledge gap in clinical immunology. A rheumatologist would have immediately recognized that speckled ANA favors anti-U1 RNP/MCTD over anti-dsDNA/SLE, would have properly contextualized ACR classification criteria as research tools rather than diagnostic scoring systems, and would have included cryoglobulinemia in the Round 1 differential as a standard part of hypocomplementemia workup. The current team topology lacks autoimmune/rheumatologic domain expertise, which was the central domain of this case.

An infectious disease specialist would have flagged viral mimicry as a mandatory exclusion in any case with hypocomplementemia, glomerulonephritis, cytopenias, and positive ANA.

While all three correctly identified lead poisoning in this case \u2014 largely because the case narrative provided strong directional cues \u2014 in a less explicitly framed case, the institution lacks a specialist whose PRIMARY domain expertise is toxic and environmental etiologies. A toxicologist would: (1) systematically evaluate exposure histories as their core competency; (2) recognize exposure-specific clinical patterns (heavy metal syndromes, organophosphate toxicity, solvent encephalopathy) that other specialists may only encounter in textbooks; (3) provide chelation therapy guidance and exposure assessment expertise; (4) serve as a structural counterweight to the institution's current bias toward genetic, developmental, and neurological etiologies.

The developmental pediatrician partially fills this role but is oriented toward developmental and pediatric conditions. An internal medicine generalist would: (1) naturally synthesize across organ systems as their primary skill; (2) be trained to recognize multisystem toxic, autoimmune, infectious, and infiltrative diseases; (3) serve as a counterweight to specialty-specific tunnel vision; (4) be the most likely team member to generate the 'Fragmented Diagnosis Map' required by proposed A-018.

The echocardiogram interpretation, medical stabilization protocol (diuretics, afterload reduction, caloric optimization), pulmonary hypertension trajectory assessment, and Eisenmenger risk timeline all required domain knowledge that was approximated but not deeply held by the current team. A pediatric cardiologist would have: (a) immediately identified the missing ECG as a critical gap at intake rather than during analysis; (b) provided expert interpretation of the echo hemodynamics and their adequacy to explain FTT severity; (c) assessed surgical timing with granular expertise (weeks vs. months, medical optimization targets); (d) evaluated the RVSP 45mmHg in the specific context of infant PVR physiology and Eisenmenger risk.

The case's central diagnostic failure occurred within hematology's domain \u2014 a hematologist was consulted in the real-world timeline and failed to connect hemolysis markers to the clinical syndrome. The EDI's current specialists (neurologist, developmental pediatrician, geneticist) all correctly identified sickle cell disease, but their expertise lies in recognizing clinical patterns rather than in hematologic nuance. Specifically, the genotype discrimination analysis (HbSS vs. HbSC vs. HbS/\u03b2+-thalassemia) \u2014 which has direct management implications (hydroxyurea dosing, retinopathy screening priority, transfusion thresholds) \u2014 was performed by the developmental pediatrician and geneticist, neither of whom are domain experts in hemoglobinopathy management. A hematologist agent would provide: (1) expert interpretation of hemolysis marker constellations, including recognition of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia patterns that were missed in the real-world case; (2) genotype-specific management recommendations informed by current SCD treatment guidelines; (3) domain authority for evaluating thrombotic complications of hemoglobinopathies, preventing the tunnel-vision failure where a real-world hematologist evaluated thrombophilia without considering hemoglobin disorders. The hematologist should be activated for cases involving unexplained anemia, hemolysis markers, thrombotic events with negative hypercoagulability workup, or cytopenias.",

The BCBA (Jennifer Mallory) similarly provided the most powerful early evidence against ASD through quantitative treatment response data (VB-MAPP decline of 68.3%). Both of these clinicians operated outside the physician diagnostic hierarchy but possessed domain expertise (motor function assessment, behavioral intervention response monitoring) that was diagnostically critical. For cases involving progressive motor regression, neuromuscular decline, or treatment non-response to rehabilitation interventions, the institution should have the option to include a rehabilitation medicine specialist who can interpret PT/OT quantitative data, evaluate motor trajectory patterns, distinguish static from progressive motor impairment, and integrate treatment response data into the diagnostic formulation. This agent would be activated for cases flagged with motor regression, progressive gait abnormality, treatment non-response to motor/behavioral interventions, or allied health professional concerns about atypical trajectories.",
