Abrams, Pediatrics\nConsulting Cardiologist: Dr. M. Fernandez, MD, FACC\n\nREASON FOR REFERRAL:\n17-year-old female varsity soccer player with recurrent near-syncope and palpitations x4 months. One episode of syncope with LOC during soccer game. Referred for cardiac evaluation.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nSofia is a previously healthy 17yo female who presents with a 4-month history of progressive exercise intolerance, palpitations, and one syncopal episode. She reports palpitations are worst at night and with minimal exertion. She previously trained 5 days/week for varsity soccer but is now unable to complete a practice session. She denies chest pain. She reports occasional \"skipped beats.\" She has lost approximately 12 pounds over the past 4 months.\n\nRecent ER visit for syncope during soccer game showed Potassium 3.1 and Calcium 11.8 \u2014 discharged as \"vasovagal syncope.\"\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Previously healthy. No prior cardiac history.\nMEDICATIONS: None\nALLERGIES: NKDA\nFAMILY HISTORY: Maternal grandmother \u2014 thyroid surgery age 52. Father \u2014 hypertension. No known family history of sudden cardiac death, cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmias.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Junior in high school. Varsity soccer. No tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n- VS: HR 106 (resting), BP 128/68, RR 16, SpO2 99% RA, Temp 37.2C\n- General: Thin, anxious-appearing female. Appears older than stated age.\n- HEENT: ** Fine tremor of outstretched hands noted. ** Mild proptosis questionable. No lid lag. Thyroid not palpated (exam limited by body habitus).\n- CV: Tachycardic, regular rhythm. Grade II/VI systolic click-murmur at apex, consistent with mitral valve prolapse. No S3/S4. No rub.\n- Lungs: Clear bilaterally.\n- Extremities: No edema. ** Warm, moist skin noted. ** Brisk deep tendon reflexes (3+).\n- Neuro: Appropriate. Fine resting tremor bilateral hands.\n\nELECTROCARDIOGRAM:\n- Sinus tachycardia at 106 bpm\n- Normal axis\n- Normal intervals (PR 148ms, QRS 86ms, QTc 412ms)\n- No ST-T wave abnormalities\n- No evidence of pre-excitation (WPW)\n- No evidence of Brugada pattern\n\nECHOCARDIOGRAM:\n- Normal LV size and systolic function (EF 62%)\n- Mild mitral valve prolapse (posterior leaflet, 3mm displacement)\n- Trace mitral regurgitation\n- Normal RV size and function\n- No pericardial effusion\n- Normal aortic root dimensions\n\n24-HOUR HOLTER MONITOR:\n- Average HR 98 bpm (range 72-142)\n- Sinus tachycardia throughout, inappropriate for activity level\n- 847 PACs in 24 hours (elevated)\n- 12 brief runs of SVT (longest 6 beats)\n- No ventricular ectopy\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia \u2014 resting HR consistently >100\n2. Mild mitral valve prolapse with trace MR \u2014 hemodynamically insignificant\n3. Frequent PACs with brief SVT runs \u2014 likely secondary to above\n4. ** SIGNIFICANT CONCERN: The combination of resting tachycardia, weight loss, tremor, warm moist skin, and hyperreflexia is NOT a primary cardiac presentation. This is highly suspicious for THYROTOXICOSIS. I am requesting thyroid function testing urgently. **\n\nPLAN:\n1. Start metoprolol 25mg BID for symptomatic tachycardia and PAC suppression\n2. ** URGENT: TSH, Free T4, Free T3 \u2014 ordered today **\n3. ** Recommend endocrinology referral if thyroid labs abnormal **\n4. Recheck ER labs: the Potassium 3.1 and Calcium 11.8 from prior ER visit are concerning and should NOT have been dismissed. Hypokalemia + hypercalcemia in a young patient warrants metabolic workup.\n5. Restrict from competitive athletics until etiology clarified\n6. Follow-up in 2 weeks or sooner if thyroid labs abnormal\n\nNOTE TO REFERRING PHYSICIAN:\nDr. Abrams \u2014 I want to flag that Sofia's presentation is almost certainly NOT primarily cardiac. The mitral valve prolapse is incidental. Her tachycardia, weight loss, tremor, hyperreflexia, and warm skin form a classic thyrotoxicosis picture. The electrolyte derangements from her ER visit (hypokalemia, hypercalcemia) were inappropriately dismissed. Please ensure thyroid labs and a metabolic panel are followed urgently. I am also concerned about the hypercalcemia \u2014 this should prompt a PTH level and consideration of parathyroid pathology.\n\nElectronically signed: Dr. M.

Abrams, Pediatrics\nGastroenterologist: Dr. P. Ramirez, MD\n\nREASON FOR REFERRAL:\n17yo F with 3-month history of chronic diarrhea (4-5 loose stools daily), weight loss. Evaluate for celiac disease vs. IBD vs. other etiology.\n\nHISTORY:\nSofia presents with progressive diarrhea over the past 3 months. She describes 4-5 loose, non-bloody stools daily. She denies mucus, melena, or hematochezia. She reports mild, diffuse abdominal cramping but no focal pain. She denies nausea or vomiting. She reports weight loss of 12 pounds.\n\nShe has been evaluated by psychiatry who ruled out eating disorder. She reports good appetite with continued weight loss.\n\nShe also reports recent syncope during athletics and was seen by cardiology who found mild MVP and tachycardia. She is currently on metoprolol 25mg BID.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n- Reports increased frequency of bowel movements, especially after meals\n- No nocturnal diarrhea (this argues against IBD)\n- Heat intolerance\n- Palpitations (on beta-blocker)\n- Tremor\n- Fatigue\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\n- VS: HR 94 (on metoprolol), BP 122/72, Wt 124 lbs, Ht 5'6\"\n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Normoactive bowel sounds (possibly hyperactive). No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses.\n- Rectal: Deferred (patient is minor, examination not clinically indicated)\n\nLABS ORDERED AND RESULTS:\n- Celiac Panel (tTG-IgA): 3.2 U/mL [<20] \u2014 NEGATIVE\n- Total IgA: 245 mg/dL [normal] \u2014 rules out IgA deficiency false negative\n- H. pylori stool antigen: NEGATIVE\n- Stool calprotectin: 42 mcg/g [<50] \u2014 NORMAL (argues strongly against IBD)\n- Stool culture: No pathogens\n- C. difficile toxin: NEGATIVE\n- Ova and parasites: NEGATIVE\n- Stool elastase: >500 mcg/g [>200] \u2014 NORMAL (rules out pancreatic insufficiency)\n- CRP: 0.8 mg/L [<3.0] \u2014 NORMAL\n- ESR: 6 mm/hr [0-20] \u2014 NORMAL\n\nASSESSMENT:\nChronic diarrhea in a 17-year-old female. Celiac disease, IBD, infectious etiology, and pancreatic insufficiency have been ruled out. Normal inflammatory markers make IBD very unlikely.\n\nDIAGNOSIS: Irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), likely stress-related given her multiple recent medical evaluations and academic/athletic disruptions.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Low-FODMAP diet trial for 6 weeks\n2. Loperamide 2mg PRN for acute episodes\n3. Consider psyllium fiber supplementation\n4. Follow-up in 8 weeks\n\n** NOTE ADDED IN RETROSPECT (Dr. Ramirez, 2026-02-01): **\n** Upon learning of Sofia's subsequent ER visit revealing thyrotoxicosis (TSH 0.08, FT4 4.2), I want to document that thyrotoxicosis is a well-known cause of increased GI motility and diarrhea. Her diarrhea was almost certainly a manifestation of hyperthyroidism, NOT IBS. I did not order thyroid function tests at the time of my consultation because I was not aware that the cardiologist had recommended thyroid testing 12 days earlier and it had not yet been done. Better communication between providers may have prevented this diagnostic delay. I should also have given more weight to the weight-loss-with-increased-appetite pattern, which is atypical for IBS and more consistent with a hypermetabolic state. **\n\nElectronically signed: Dr. P.

Kapoor, Emergency Medicine\nRadiologist: Dr. A. Whitfield, MD\n\nCLINICAL INDICATION:\n17yo F with suppressed TSH, elevated Free T4/T3, hypercalcemia. Evaluate thyroid and parathyroid glands.\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nHigh-resolution ultrasonography of the neck was performed using a 12-5 MHz linear transducer. Gray-scale and color Doppler images obtained in transverse and longitudinal planes.\n\nFINDINGS:\n\nTHYROID GLAND:\n- Right lobe: 5.2 x 2.1 x 1.8 cm (mildly enlarged)\n- Left lobe: 4.8 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm (upper normal)\n- Isthmus: 4mm (normal)\n- Echotexture: Heterogeneous with diffusely increased vascularity bilaterally on Doppler (\"thyroid inferno\" pattern), consistent with Graves' disease or thyroiditis.\n\nRIGHT THYROID NODULE:\n- Location: Mid-to-lower pole, right lobe\n- Size: 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm\n- Characteristics: Solid, hypoechoic, taller-than-wide orientation\n- Margins: Irregular, with one area of possible microlobulation\n- Calcifications: Punctate echogenic foci present (suspicious for microcalcifications)\n- Vascularity: Moderate internal vascularity\n- ** TI-RADS Score: 5 (Highly Suspicious) **\n- ** RECOMMENDATION: FNA biopsy indicated **\n\nLEFT THYROID:\n- No discrete nodules identified\n- Heterogeneous echogenicity consistent with diffuse thyroid disease\n\nPARATHYROID GLANDS:\n- Right superior: Not visualized (normal)\n- Right inferior: ** 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm hypoechoic ovoid lesion posterior to the right inferior thyroid pole. Demonstrates a characteristic polar feeding vessel on color Doppler. Appearance is classic for a PARATHYROID ADENOMA. **\n- Left superior: Not visualized (normal)\n- Left inferior: Not visualized (normal)\n\nCERVICAL LYMPH NODES:\n- Multiple small lymph nodes in bilateral levels II-IV, largest 0.9cm in left level III\n- Morphology: Preserved fatty hila, benign-appearing\n- No suspicious lymphadenopathy identified\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. DIFFUSE THYROID DISEASE with \"thyroid inferno\" Doppler pattern \u2014 consistent with Graves' disease in the setting of known thyrotoxicosis (suppressed TSH, elevated FT4/FT3).\n\n2. RIGHT THYROID NODULE, 1.2 cm, TI-RADS 5 (HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS) \u2014 solid, hypoechoic, taller-than-wide, punctate echogenic foci (microcalcifications), irregular margins. In a 17-year-old with thyrotoxicosis, this raises concern for THYROID CARCINOMA, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma. FNA biopsy is strongly recommended.\n\n3. RIGHT INFERIOR PARATHYROID ADENOMA, 0.8 cm \u2014 classic ultrasound appearance with polar feeding vessel. Correlates with patient's hypercalcemia (Ca 12.4) and hypophosphatemia (Phos 1.8). Consistent with PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM.\n\n4. ** CLINICAL CORRELATION: The concurrent presence of a suspicious thyroid nodule (possible carcinoma), diffuse thyroid disease (Graves'), and a parathyroid adenoma in a 17-year-old patient is HIGHLY UNUSUAL and should raise strong suspicion for MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA TYPE 2A (MEN2A) or possibly MEN1. Genetic testing (RET proto-oncogene for MEN2A, MEN1 gene) is urgently recommended. **\n\n5. No suspicious cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n- Urgent endocrinology consultation\n- FNA biopsy of right thyroid nodule\n- Sestamibi scan for parathyroid adenoma confirmation\n- ** Genetic testing for MEN syndromes given age and concurrent pathology **\n- PTH level correlation\n\nElectronically signed: Dr. A.

Abrams, MD, FAAP\n\n========================================\nVISIT 1: 2025-08-22\n========================================\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Near-syncope during soccer practice\n\nHPI: Sofia is a healthy 16yo (turning 17 next month) varsity soccer player who nearly fainted during practice yesterday. She reports feeling lightheaded, vision \"going gray,\" and needing to sit down. She did not lose consciousness. No prior history of syncope. She had practice in 92F heat.\n\nEXAM: Unremarkable. HR 88, BP 110/70. Well-hydrated on exam today.\n\nASSESSMENT: Exercise-associated near-syncope, likely heat/dehydration related.\n\nPLAN:\n- Increase fluid intake during practice\n- Sports drink with electrolytes\n- Return if recurs\n\n========================================\nVISIT 2: 2025-09-18\n========================================\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Palpitations, racing heart\n\nHPI: Sofia returns reporting 3 weeks of intermittent palpitations, worse at night. Reports difficulty falling asleep due to \"heart pounding.\" Denies chest pain or dyspnea. No further syncope but reports decreased exercise tolerance \u2014 \"can't keep up at practice anymore.\"\n\nEXAM: HR 110 resting (repeated x2, confirmed). BP 126/72. Rhythm regular. No murmur appreciated at this visit. Patient appears anxious.\n\nASSESSMENT: Sinus tachycardia with palpitations. Most likely anxiety-related given high-achieving student-athlete presentation. Will monitor.\n\nPLAN:\n- Reassurance\n- Sleep hygiene counseling\n- Follow-up in 4 weeks\n- If persists, consider cardiology referral\n\n========================================\nVISIT 3: 2025-10-15\n========================================\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Weight loss, increased appetite, frequent urination\n\nHPI: Sofia has lost 8 pounds since last visit (138 \u2192 130 lbs). Mother is very concerned. Sofia reports eating well \u2014 \"more than normal actually\" \u2014 but losing weight. Reports increased thirst (drinks 4-5 water bottles daily) and frequent urination (8-10 times/day). Palpitations continue.\n\nEXAM: HR 108. BP 124/68. Wt 130 lbs (was 138 in August). Thin but not cachectic.\n\nLABS:\n- Fasting glucose: 95 mg/dL [<100] \u2014 Normal\n- HbA1c: 5.2% [<5.7] \u2014 Normal\n- CBC: Within normal limits\n- BMP: Potassium 3.6 (low-normal), Calcium not ordered\n\nASSESSMENT: Unintentional weight loss with polydipsia/polyuria. Diabetes mellitus ruled out. Consider stress-related weight loss vs. possible eating disorder given age demographic.\n\nPLAN:\n- Psychiatric referral to evaluate for eating disorder\n- Continue monitoring weight\n- Return in 4 weeks\n\n** NOTE: In retrospect, thyroid function tests should have been ordered at this visit. The combination of weight loss + increased appetite + tachycardia + polydipsia is a textbook presentation of hyperthyroidism. A basic metabolic panel with calcium should also have been checked. I documented potassium 3.6 (low-normal) but did not order calcium. **\n\n========================================\nVISIT 4: 2025-11-20\n========================================\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up weight loss. Psychiatry report received.\n\nHPI: Sofia has now lost 12 lbs total (138 \u2192 126). Psychiatrist Dr. Okonkwo evaluated and found NO eating disorder. Psychiatrist noted tremor, diaphoresis, and recommended urgent thyroid testing.\n\n** Dr. Okonkwo's recommendations received 2025-11-10. Thyroid labs were not ordered at that time due to scheduling \u2014 next available appointment was this visit, 10 days later. **\n\nShe also reports new symptom: chronic loose stools, 4-5 times daily x 2 weeks. Reports abdominal cramping.\n\nEXAM: HR 112. BP 128/70. Wt 126 lbs. Fine bilateral hand tremor present. Warm, moist palms.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Progressive weight loss \u2014 eating disorder ruled out by psychiatry\n2. New-onset chronic diarrhea\n3. Tachycardia, persistent\n4. Tremor noted (new finding)\n\nPLAN:\n- Cardiology referral for tachycardia evaluation and syncope history\n- GI referral for chronic diarrhea\n- ** Thyroid testing: DEFERRED to cardiology or GI workup \u2014 one of the specialists can order as part of their workup **\n\n** NOTE: This was a critical error. Dr. Okonkwo specifically requested urgent thyroid testing on 11/10. By deferring to specialists, the test was delayed an additional 2+ months (cardiology saw her 12/18, ordered thyroid labs, but results were not acted upon in my office). The cascade of specialist referrals without a unifying diagnostic hypothesis led to fragmented care. **\n\n========================================\nVISIT 5: 2026-01-15\n========================================\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up. Multiple specialist reports received.\n\nHPI: Sofia continues to worsen. Now 122 lbs (16 lb total loss). Too fatigued for school some days. Missing soccer entirely. Mother is increasingly frustrated with lack of diagnosis.\n\nSPECIALIST REPORTS RECEIVED:\n- Psychiatry (11/10): No eating disorder. Recommended urgent thyroid testing.\n- Cardiology (12/18): Mild MVP, sinus tachycardia. Started metoprolol. Recommended URGENT thyroid testing and endocrine workup. ** Flagged that ER electrolytes (K 3.1, Ca 11.8) were inappropriately dismissed. **\n- GI (12/30): Celiac negative, IBD ruled out. Diagnosed IBS-D.\n\n** CRITICAL REVIEW: Both the psychiatrist AND the cardiologist recommended urgent thyroid testing. The cardiologist also flagged the dismissed electrolyte abnormalities. As of today's visit, thyroid labs have STILL not been drawn \u2014 2 months after first recommendation. **\n\nPLAN:\n- Ordered TSH and Free T4 today \u2014 results expected in 3-5 days\n- ** Lab order was placed but patient had her second syncopal episode with ER visit on 1/28 before results were obtained from our office lab **\n- Full metabolic workup including calcium, PTH to be ordered\n- Endocrinology referral pending lab results\n\nDOCUMENTATION NOTE:\nThis case illustrates a failure of care coordination. Three specialists identified clues pointing to a systemic endocrine disorder, but the absence of a unifying diagnostic framework \u2014 and the deferral of simple thyroid labs across multiple visits \u2014 resulted in a diagnostic delay of approximately 5 months from initial presentation.\n\nElectronically signed: Dr. L.

Abrams, Pediatrics\nEvaluating Psychiatrist: Dr. K. Okonkwo, MD\n\nREASON FOR REFERRAL:\n17yo F referred for evaluation of possible eating disorder. Patient has lost 12 pounds in 3 months. Pediatrician concerned for anorexia nervosa vs. bulimia.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nSofia presents at the request of her pediatrician who is concerned about a 12-pound unintentional weight loss over 3 months. Patient went from 138 lbs to 126 lbs (BMI from 22.1 to 20.2). She is 5'6\".\n\nSofia denies any desire to lose weight. She reports she has been eating normally \u2014 in fact, she states she has been eating MORE than usual because she feels constantly hungry. She denies any purging behaviors, laxative use, excessive exercise for weight control, or body image disturbance. She denies caloric restriction. She reports she eats 3 meals and 2 snacks daily.\n\nShe reports 4-5 loose stools daily for approximately 2 months, which she attributes to \"something being wrong with my stomach.\" She reports increased thirst and frequent urination. She reports feeling \"hot all the time\" \u2014 wears shorts in November while classmates are in jackets.\n\nShe reports anxiety symptoms: racing heart, difficulty sleeping, feeling \"wired\" and unable to relax. She reports these are NEW symptoms that began around the same time as the weight loss \u2014 approximately 3-4 months ago. No prior psychiatric history.\n\nShe reports difficulty concentrating in school, which she attributes to fatigue from poor sleep. She denies depressed mood, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, or self-harm.\n\nShe is distressed about missing soccer due to exercise intolerance and syncope. She describes herself as \"frustrated, not depressed\" and feels \"something is physically wrong\" that doctors are not finding.\n\nMENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:\n- Appearance: Thin but not cachectic. Well-groomed. Notably diaphoretic.\n- Psychomotor: Mild psychomotor agitation. Fine bilateral hand tremor noted.\n- Speech: Normal rate and rhythm (possibly slightly pressured)\n- Mood: \"Frustrated\"\n- Affect: Anxious, reactive, full range\n- Thought Process: Linear, goal-directed\n- Thought Content: No SI/HI. No delusions. Preoccupied with physical symptoms.\n- Cognition: Alert, oriented x4. Normal attention.\n- Insight/Judgment: Good. Patient demonstrates appropriate health-seeking behavior.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. ** NO EATING DISORDER IDENTIFIED. ** Patient does not meet criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or ARFID. She has no body image disturbance, no desire for weight loss, no restrictive or purging behaviors, and reports INCREASED appetite with weight loss. This pattern is inconsistent with any primary psychiatric eating disorder.\n\n2. Anxiety symptoms (NOS) \u2014 however, I have SIGNIFICANT CONCERN that these are secondary to a medical condition rather than a primary psychiatric disorder. The constellation of:\n   - Weight loss WITH increased appetite\n   - Heat intolerance\n   - Tachycardia and palpitations\n   - Tremor (observed on exam)\n   - Diaphoresis (observed on exam)\n   - Loose stools / GI hypermotility\n   - Sleep disturbance\n   - Psychomotor agitation\n   ...is CLASSIC for HYPERTHYROIDISM. This is NOT an anxiety disorder.\n\n3. ** I am NOT diagnosing a primary psychiatric condition at this time. **\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. ** URGENT thyroid function testing: TSH, Free T4, Free T3. I believe this patient has undiagnosed hyperthyroidism until proven otherwise. **\n2. Do NOT start psychiatric medications (SSRIs, benzodiazepines) until medical workup is complete. Beta-blocker would be more appropriate if thyrotoxicosis is confirmed.\n3. Return to psychiatry ONLY if thyroid workup is normal \u2014 which I do not expect.\n4. I am calling Dr. Abrams directly to communicate this concern.\n\nCOMMUNICATION:\nCalled Dr. Abrams' office at 11:45am. Spoke with nurse. Message left requesting URGENT thyroid panel. Follow-up call at 2:15pm \u2014 Dr. Abrams' office states they will \"add it to the next visit.\" I expressed my concern about urgency. Office states next appointment is in 6 weeks.\n\n** ADDENDUM (2025-11-10, 3:30pm): I am documenting my concern that a 6-week delay in thyroid testing for this patient is inappropriate given the clinical picture. If this patient has thyrotoxicosis, a 6-week delay risks thyroid storm, cardiac complications, or bone loss. I recommend this be escalated. **\n\nElectronically signed: Dr. K.
