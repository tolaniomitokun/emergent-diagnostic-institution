The combination of regression + stereotypic movements + possible seizures should have triggered consideration of Rett-like syndromes or neurometabolic conditions. The ASD diagnosis anchored all subsequent providers."

    "age_4_to_7": {
      "observations": "Started ABA therapy for autism. Made minimal progress. Teachers noted he seemed to be losing skills he'd previously had — could button his shirt at 4, couldn't at 6. Walking became increasingly unsteady. Parents reported he would occasionally 'zone out' for 15-30 seconds and seem confused afterward. Started having sleep disturbances — waking at night appearing frightened and disoriented.",

The mildly prominent ventricles on MRI, combined with motor regression, should have prompted metabolic workup or genetic testing. The neurologist only had 2 years of records and accepted the prior ASD label. The night episodes could have been nocturnal seizures — no EEG was ordered."

Speech became more effortful — went from short sentences to mostly single words. Staring episodes became more frequent (2-3 per day). Parents noticed subtle jerking movements during sleep.

The 6-year-old MRI was at a different hospital and had been read as 'normal variant.' Had anyone reviewed the full imaging timeline earlier, the progressive nature would have been apparent years sooner. The elevated lactate was noted but not urgently followed up — the family was told to schedule a genetics appointment (4-month wait)."

      "observations": "Family moved again (military family). Records transfer was incomplete — the EEG results and the neurologist's recommendation for genetic workup were not in the transferred file. New providers started largely from scratch.

Every provider since age 3.5 had anchored on the ASD label."

  "demo_narrative": {
    "opening": "Eli Reeves has been to 8 doctors in 3 states over 12 years. He has a thick binder of medical records that his mother carries everywhere. No one has ever read it all. Today, for the first time, every page of that binder is loaded into one system — and that system has the cognitive capacity to review it all at once, debate what it means across specialties, and catch the biases that kept every human doctor anchored on the wrong answer for a decade.",
    "climax": "The Metacognitive Observer interrupts the team: 'CRITICAL ANCHORING DETECTED. The ASD diagnosis from age 3.5 has been accepted without challenge by every subsequent provider. However, the trajectory — regression of acquired motor and speech skills, progressive cerebellar atrophy across 4 MRI scans, epileptiform activity, elevated lactate — is inconsistent with ASD and consistent with a progressive neurometabolic disorder. Constitutional Rule 6: The original diagnosis must not anchor the differential. I am demanding exploration of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and related conditions.'",
    "resolution": "The specialist team converges on NCL with 87% confidence. The Patient Translator explains to Eli's mother: 'After reviewing your son's complete medical history — all 12 years, all the tests, all the notes — our team believes Eli may have a condition called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. This would explain everything: why he developed normally at first, why he lost skills over time, why the seizures started, and why his brain scans show progressive changes. This is not autism. This is a rare neurometabolic condition, and there are treatments and clinical trials that may help. You were right to keep pushing for answers.'",
    "emotional_close": "The system then updates its Clinical Constitution: 'New Rule — When a child diagnosed with ASD shows progressive loss of previously acquired motor skills, cerebellar changes on imaging, or treatment-resistant seizures, the ASD diagnosis must be formally re-evaluated and neurodegenerative conditions must be ruled out before the ASD label is maintained.' The next family won't wait 14 years."
