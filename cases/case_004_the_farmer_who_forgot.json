  "description": "A 52-year-old male farmer with 2-year progressive cognitive decline, tremor, and personality changes, misdiagnosed as early-onset Alzheimer's. The key missed clue is chronic heavy metal exposure from farming pesticides, old barn with peeling lead paint, and contaminated well water.",

    "history_of_present_illness": "52-year-old male farmer presenting with 2-year history of progressive cognitive decline, intention tremor, and personality changes. Wife reports he was 'sharp as a tack' until about 2 years ago. Onset was insidious: first noticed difficulty remembering where he left tools, then progressed to getting lost on his own property, forgetting to feed livestock, and inability to manage farm finances he'd handled for 30 years. Personality changes emerged approximately 18 months ago — increased irritability, emotional outbursts uncharacteristic of his baseline temperament, social withdrawal, and episodes of confusion. Tremor developed approximately 14 months ago, initially in hands, now affecting both upper extremities. Progressive fatigue and weakness over 12 months. Chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and intermittent nausea for 10 months. Lost 18 pounds over past year. Wife also notes he has developed a bluish-gray discoloration along his gum line that was evaluated by his dentist as 'periodontal disease' 6 months ago. He has been seen by 5 providers over the past 2 years: his PCP, a neurologist, a neuropsychologist, a GI specialist, and a dentist. No provider has ordered heavy metal testing despite his occupational and environmental exposures.",

    "social_history": "Farmer for 30 years on 200-acre family farm. Grows corn and soybeans. Uses pesticides and herbicides regularly — applies them himself without consistent use of respiratory protection or gloves. Farm has an old barn (built 1940s) with peeling paint that he scrapes and maintains himself. Property uses well water for drinking and irrigation — well is approximately 60 years old, downstream from a former industrial site. No history of well water testing. Non-smoker. Social drinker (2-3 beers on weekends). No recreational drugs. Married 28 years, two adult children. Wife is his primary caregiver.",

Orders iron studies — serum iron low, TIBC high, ferritin low-normal. Starts iron supplementation. Does not order peripheral smear.
