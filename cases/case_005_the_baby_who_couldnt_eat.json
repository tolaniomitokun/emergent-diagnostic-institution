  "description": "A 4-month-old female infant with poor feeding, failure to thrive, tachypnea, and perioral cyanosis. Undiagnosed large ventricular septal defect causing congestive heart failure. 5 visits over 4 months before cardiac evaluation.",
  "patient": {
    "age_months": 4,
    "sex": "female",
    "chief_complaint": "Poor feeding, excessive sweating during feeds, and failure to thrive",
    "history_of_present_illness": "4-month-old female infant brought to pediatrician for poor feeding, excessive sweating during feeds, and failure to thrive. Birth history: Full-term, normal vaginal delivery, birth weight 7 lbs 2 oz (3.23 kg). Newborn screen normal. Passed hearing screen. No abnormalities noted at birth. At 2-week visit, weight gain was appropriate. Parents noted she seemed to breathe fast but were told 'newborns breathe differently.' At 1-month visit, weight gain was slowing. Pediatrician noted mild tachypnea (RR 55) but attributed to 'just finished crying.' Advised to supplement with formula if breastfeeding insufficient. At 2-month visit, weight dropped from 50th percentile to 15th percentile. Parents report she gets sweaty and tired after only 2-3 minutes of feeding, then falls asleep. Has to be woken to finish feeds. Pediatrician diagnosed 'poor latch' and referred to lactation consultant. At 3-month visit, now below 5th percentile for weight. Lactation consultant confirmed adequate milk supply and latch. Referred back to pediatrician with note: 'This baby fatigues abnormally during feeds. Please evaluate cardiopulmonary.' Pediatrician ordered chest X-ray — read as 'mild cardiomegaly, possibly normal variant in infant.' No follow-up ordered. At 3.5 months: ER visit for 'respiratory infection.' RSV negative. Flu negative. Noted hepatomegaly on exam but attributed to 'examiner variation.' Discharged with 'viral URI.' Current presentation at 4 months: Weight now below 3rd percentile. Parents describe episodes where she turns slightly blue around the lips during feeds. Persistent tachypnea (RR 60-70 at rest). Excessive sweating on forehead during feeds. Pediatrician hears a murmur for the first time — 'soft systolic murmur, grade II/VI, left sternal border.' Orders echocardiogram.",

FINDINGS: Large perimembranous ventricular septal defect measuring 8mm with predominant left-to-right shunt by color flow Doppler. Left atrial dilation (LA:Ao ratio 2.1, normal <1.5). Left ventricular dilation with preserved systolic function (EF 58%). Right ventricular systolic pressure estimated at 45 mmHg by tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity (elevated, suggesting pulmonary hypertension). Moderate mitral regurgitation secondary to annular dilation from left ventricular volume overload. No aortic arch abnormalities. Normal systemic and pulmonary venous return. IMPRESSION: Large perimembranous VSD with hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunt. Volume overload of left atrium and left ventricle. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Moderate secondary mitral regurgitation. Findings consistent with congestive heart failure physiology."
