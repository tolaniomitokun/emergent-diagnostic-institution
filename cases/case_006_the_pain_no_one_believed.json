  "description": "A 28-year-old African American female graphic designer with 3-year history of episodic severe pain crises, chronic joint pain, recurrent leg ulcers, and unprovoked PE. Hemolysis markers (elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, elevated reticulocytes, elevated indirect bilirubin) were in the chart for over a year but never connected to her symptoms. 8 providers seen over 3 years. Likely sickle cell disease variant (HbSC or sickle-beta thalassemia).",

    "history_of_present_illness": "28-year-old African American female graphic designer presenting with 3-year history of episodic severe pain crises, chronic joint pain, and recurrent leg ulcers. First episode 3 years ago: excruciating pain in lower back and hips lasting 3 days. ER visit — given IV morphine, CT abdomen normal, discharged with 'musculoskeletal pain, possible kidney stone that passed.' No stone seen on imaging. Second episode 2.5 years ago: pain crisis affecting chest and arms. ER visit — troponin negative, ECG normal, CT chest negative for PE. Diagnosed 'costochondritis and anxiety.' Prescribed naproxen. 2 years ago: developed chronic aching in knees and ankles. Rheumatologist tested ANA (negative), RF (negative), HLA-B27 (negative). Diagnosed 'fibromyalgia.' Started duloxetine. 18 months ago: non-healing ulcer appeared on left ankle. Dermatologist performed biopsy — 'nonspecific ulceration with inflammation.' Treated with wound care. Healed after 3 months. 12 months ago: another pain crisis with fever of 102F. Hospitalized for 4 days. Blood cultures negative. CT chest showed small bilateral pulmonary emboli. Started anticoagulation with apixaban (Eliquis) for 'unprovoked PE.' Hematology workup for clotting disorders: Factor V Leiden negative, Protein C and S normal, antiphospholipid antibodies negative. 8 months ago: new ulcer on right ankle. Patient mentions her brother had similar pain episodes as a child and was told he had 'blood problems' but family doesn't discuss it further. 6 months ago: CBC reviewed — Hgb 9.2, MCV 88, reticulocyte count 8% (elevated), LDH 380 (elevated), indirect bilirubin 2.1 (elevated), haptoglobin <10 (critically low). These results were in the system from the hospitalization a year ago but were never specifically addressed or connected to her pain crises. Currently: chronic pain rated 5/10 daily with intermittent crises reaching 10/10. Two non-healing ankle ulcers. Fatigue. On duloxetine 60mg daily and apixaban 5mg BID.",
