34-year-old female elementary school teacher presenting with 18-month history of progressive fatigue, polyarthralgia, recurrent fevers, malar rash, alopecia, oral ulcers, pleuritic chest pain, Raynaud phenomenon, and inflammatory arthritis. Classic undiagnosed Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with fragmented care across 6 providers.

18 months ago: Onset of profound fatigue. Unable to keep up with classroom demands. PCP diagnosed "occupational burnout" and recommended stress management. 14 months ago: Bilateral pain and morning stiffness in hands and wrists, lasting >1 hour daily. PCP ordered rheumatoid factor — negative. Diagnosed "repetitive strain injury" from writing and classroom work. Started naproxen PRN. 12 months ago: Recurrent low-grade fevers (99.5-100.4F) every 2-3 weeks, each lasting 3-5 days. PCP diagnosed "recurrent viral infections" given school setting exposure. CBC showed mild anemia (Hgb 10.8), attributed to heavy menstrual periods. Started iron supplementation. 10 months ago: Erythematous rash across bilateral cheeks and nasal bridge after weekend at the beach. Dermatologist diagnosed "acute sunburn with photosensitivity reaction." Prescribed topical hydrocortisone, advised sunscreen. No systemic workup. 8 months ago: Progressive hair thinning, diffuse, with increased shedding on pillows and in shower. Same dermatologist diagnosed "telogen effluvium secondary to physiologic stress." Recommended biotin supplements and stress reduction. 6 months ago: Recurring painful oral ulcers (buccal mucosa and hard palate) appearing every 2-3 weeks and lasting 7-10 days. Dentist found no evidence of infection, HSV, or aphthous stomatitis etiology. Prescribed topical triamcinolone paste. 4 months ago: Acute pleuritic chest pain — sharp, worsening with inspiration and coughing. Presented to ER. Chest X-ray revealed small bilateral pleural effusions. CT pulmonary angiogram negative for pulmonary embolism. D-dimer mildly elevated. Discharged with diagnosis of "viral pleurisy" and ibuprofen. No autoimmune workup. 2 months ago: New Raynaud phenomenon — bilateral fingers turning white then blue then red with cold exposure. PCP finally ordered ANA — positive at 1:640, speckled pattern. Referred to rheumatology, but next available appointment is 3 months out. 1 month ago: Urgent care visit for acute bilateral knee swelling and pain. Arthrocentesis performed: inflammatory synovial fluid (WBC 8,500/mm3, 78% neutrophils), no crystals, no organisms. Urinalysis showed proteinuria 2+ and microscopic hematuria (RBC 10-15/hpf). Assessment: inflammatory polyarthritis with concern for lupus nephritis. Recommendation for expedited rheumatology referral. Current: Awaiting rheumatology appointment. Taking ibuprofen 600mg TID for joint pain with marginal relief. Considering medical leave from teaching. Progressive functional decline — unable to play with her 4-year-old son, difficulty gripping objects, intermittent fevers continuing.

Laboratory summary (most recent): ANA positive 1:640 speckled pattern, RF negative, Hgb 10.2 (low — progressive decline), WBC 3.1 (low — leukopenia), Platelets 128 (low — mild thrombocytopenia), ESR 58 (elevated), CRP 24 (elevated), C3 45 (low — hypocomplementemia), C4 8 (low — hypocomplementemia), Urine protein 2+, Urine RBC 10-15/hpf (microscopic hematuria). Progressive cytopenias and rising inflammatory markers documented over 12 months.

6 providers seen (PCP, dermatologist, dentist, ER physician, urgent care physician, pending rheumatologist). Each provider treated symptoms in isolation. No provider synthesized the constellation of fatigue + arthralgia + fevers + malar rash + alopecia + oral ulcers + serositis + Raynaud + cytopenias + renal involvement into a unifying diagnosis until the ANA was ordered 16 months into the disease course. Patient meets at least 8 of the 11 ACR classification criteria for SLE and has a SLEDAI score suggesting moderate-to-severe active disease with probable renal involvement.
