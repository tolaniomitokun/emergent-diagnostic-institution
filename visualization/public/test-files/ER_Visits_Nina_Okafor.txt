===============================================
EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN EVALUATION
===============================================
Time: 18:58

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Nina is a 25-year-old African American female who presents with approximately 8 hours of severe bilateral arm pain and diffuse anterior chest wall pain. The pain began gradually this morning while working at her desk and has progressively worsened. She describes it as a deep, aching, "squeezing" pain in both upper arms and across her sternum and anterior ribs. The pain is not clearly pleuritic — it is present at rest and does not significantly change with respiration. She denies radiation to the jaw, neck, or left arm specifically. She denies shortness of breath, palpitations, or diaphoresis.

She reports one prior episode of acute severe pain approximately 6 months ago involving her back and hips, which was evaluated at this ER and attributed to musculoskeletal pain. She reports several milder episodes of pain in various locations (knees, shoulders, ribs) in between that she managed at home with ibuprofen.

She appears anxious and tearful, stating "this is the second time this year I've had terrible pain come out of nowhere."

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Positive: Chest pain, bilateral arm pain, low-grade fever, fatigue, anxiety
Negative: Dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, leg swelling, headache, abdominal pain, dysuria, rash

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Prior ER visit 2/2023 — acute back/hip pain (musculoskeletal)
MEDICATIONS: Ibuprofen PRN
ALLERGIES: NKDA

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
General: Alert, oriented, mildly distressed. Appears anxious. Tearful intermittently. Speaking in full sentences without difficulty.
HEENT: Sclerae mildly icteric (documented but not commented upon in assessment). Conjunctivae slightly pale. Oral mucosa moist.
CV: Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles.
Chest wall: Mild tenderness to palpation over bilateral costochondral junctions (2nd-5th ribs bilaterally). Reproducible tenderness with palpation at sternum.
Extremities (upper): Bilateral upper arm tenderness to palpation, diffuse, no focal swelling, no erythema. Full ROM limited by pain. Grip strength 4/5 bilaterally (limited by pain). No joint effusions.
Extremities (lower): No edema. No calf tenderness.
Skin: No rashes. No petechiae. No bruising.
Neuro: Alert, oriented x4. Cranial nerves intact. Strength and sensation grossly intact.

** NOTE: Scleral icterus was documented in the physical examination but was not addressed in the differential diagnosis or assessment. Scleral icterus in a young African American woman with recurrent severe pain crises is a cardinal sign of sickle cell disease. **

IMAGING:
----------------------------------
CHEST X-RAY (PA and Lateral) — 19:15
Interpreted by: Dr. B. Okwu, Radiology

FINDINGS:
- Lungs clear bilaterally. No consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
- Cardiac silhouette normal in size and configuration.
- Mediastinal contours normal.
- No rib fractures.
- Osseous structures: unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Normal chest radiograph.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST — 20:30
Interpreted by: Dr. B. Okwu, Radiology

INDICATION: Chest wall pain, rule out osseous pathology, evaluate for rib pathology.

** NOTE: CT was performed WITHOUT IV contrast. This was not a PE-protocol study. Pulmonary arteries were not evaluated. **

FINDINGS:
- Lungs: Clear. No consolidation, ground-glass opacity, or mass.
- Pleura: No effusion. No pneumothorax.
- Heart and pericardium: Normal. No pericardial effusion.
- Mediastinum: No lymphadenopathy. Normal great vessels (limited evaluation without contrast).
- Chest wall and ribs: No fracture. No lytic lesions. No periosteal reaction.
- Visualized portions of upper abdomen: Spleen measures 13.5 cm — mildly prominent.
- Incidental: Mild vertebral body marrow heterogeneity noted at T8-T10. Significance uncertain. May be a normal variant.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute thoracic pathology.
2. No rib fracture or osseous lesion.
3. Mild splenomegaly (13.5 cm) — similar to prior CT abdomen from 2/2023. Clinical correlation recommended.
4. Mild vertebral marrow heterogeneity at T8-T10 — nonspecific, may warrant follow-up MRI if clinically indicated.

** NOTE: Splenomegaly was again documented (second imaging study showing this) and again not addressed clinically. Vertebral marrow heterogeneity at T8-T10 — in retrospect, this likely represents bone marrow expansion from chronic hemolysis and extramedullary hematopoiesis, a well-documented finding in sickle cell disease. **

===============================================
CLINICAL COURSE
===============================================
Patient observed for 6.5 hours. Pain management:
- Ketorolac 30mg IV at 19:10 — minimal relief
- Morphine 4mg IV at 19:45 — pain reduced 8/10 to 5/10
- Oral naproxen 500mg at 22:00 — pain stable at 4-5/10
- Diazepam 2mg PO at 22:30 for anxiety — patient calmer, pain 3-4/10

Serial troponins negative. Vital signs stabilized: HR 94, BP 130/82, temp 99.4F. Patient able to ambulate. Pain controlled on oral medications.

===============================================
ASSESSMENT AND MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
===============================================
25-year-old female presenting with acute chest wall and bilateral upper arm pain, recurrent episode (prior ER visit 6 months ago for back/hip pain).

DIFFERENTIAL CONSIDERED:
1. Acute coronary syndrome — RULED OUT by serial troponins and ECG
2. Pulmonary embolism — Low clinical suspicion (no dyspnea, no leg swelling, Wells score low). CT without contrast did not evaluate PAs. Not pursued further.
3. Costochondritis — FAVORED (reproducible chest wall tenderness)
4. Musculoskeletal pain with anxiety component — SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS
5. Pneumonia — No infiltrate on CXR
6. Rib fracture — None on CT
7. Sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis — NOT CONSIDERED

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Costochondritis
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety-related pain amplification. Mild anemia (recommend PCP follow-up for iron supplementation).

NOTE: Physician documentation includes: "Young woman with recurrent episodes of severe pain in different body regions, likely musculoskeletal in nature with significant anxiety component. Pain appears disproportionate to objective findings. Reassured patient and recommended stress management techniques and PCP follow-up for anxiety evaluation."

===============================================
DISPOSITION
===============================================
Time: 01:18 (08/06)
Disposition: Discharge to home
Condition: Improved, stable

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Naproxen 500mg every 12 hours with food for 7 days
2. Diazepam 2mg as needed for anxiety, #10 (short course, follow up with PCP)
3. Warm compresses to chest and arms
4. Follow up with PCP within 1-2 weeks for anemia evaluation and anxiety management
5. Consider referral to rheumatology if joint/bone pain recurs
6. Return to ER if: chest pain with shortness of breath, palpitations, fainting, fever >101F, worsening symptoms

FOLLOW-UP: PCP within 1-2 weeks

RETROSPECTIVE ADDENDUM — BOTH VISITS
===============================================
Added by: Emergency Department Quality Review Committee
Date: 2026-02-10

This retrospective analysis addresses both ER visits in the context of the patient's subsequent clinical course, which revealed hemolytic anemia with markers consistent with sickle cell disease (hemoglobin electrophoresis pending at time of this addendum).

VISIT 1 (02/2023) — CRITICAL OMISSIONS:
1. NO CBC WAS ORDERED during the first visit. A 25-year-old presenting with acute severe bone pain warranted basic blood work including a complete blood count. Had a CBC been drawn, anemia would likely have been identified 6 months earlier.
2. The splenomegaly (13.2 cm) documented on CT abdomen was not addressed. Splenomegaly in a young patient with acute bone pain should raise concern for a hemoglobinopathy, hematologic malignancy, or hemolytic process.
3. The pain pattern — acute onset, bilateral, deep "bone-crushing" quality, waking from sleep, requiring high-dose opioids — is characteristic of a vaso-occlusive crisis. The diagnosis of "musculoskeletal pain / kidney stone that passed" was inadequate given the severity and distribution of symptoms.

VISIT 2 (08/2023) — CRITICAL OMISSIONS:
1. RECURRENT SEVERE PAIN CRISES IN A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN SHOULD HAVE TRIGGERED SICKLE CELL SCREENING. The pattern of acute severe pain affecting different body regions on separate occasions (back/hips first visit, chest/arms second visit) is the hallmark presentation of vaso-occlusive crises. This was the single most important diagnostic clue that was missed.
2. SCLERAL ICTERUS WAS DOCUMENTED BUT NOT INVESTIGATED. The physical exam noted "sclerae mildly icteric" — this finding was never addressed in the assessment or plan. Scleral icterus in a young woman with recurrent pain crises and anemia is pathognomonic for hemolytic anemia and should have prompted LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count, and bilirubin fractionation at minimum.
3. ANEMIA (Hgb 10.1) WAS ATTRIBUTED TO MENSTRUAL LOSSES WITHOUT INVESTIGATION. No iron studies, no reticulocyte count, no peripheral smear were ordered. The elevated RDW (17.2%) was not commented upon. Menstrual losses causing anemia in a 25-year-old is possible but should not be assumed without confirming iron deficiency.
4. PAIN CHARACTERIZED AS "ANXIETY-RELATED" AND "DISPROPORTIONATE TO FINDINGS." Research has documented that pain reports from African American patients — particularly women — are systematically undertreated and more frequently attributed to psychological causes. The characterization of severe pain as anxiety-related, combined with a prescription for diazepam, reflects well-documented disparities in pain management.
5. SPLENOMEGALY WAS DOCUMENTED ON CT FOR THE SECOND TIME and again not addressed clinically.
6. VERTEBRAL MARROW HETEROGENEITY was an additional imaging clue to underlying hematologic disease that was not pursued.

Had sickle cell screening been performed at either ER visit, the diagnosis would have been established 1.5-3 years earlier, potentially preventing the bilateral PE, progression of leg ulcers, and years of undertreated pain and diagnostic uncertainty.
