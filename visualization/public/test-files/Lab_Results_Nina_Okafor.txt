  Platelets:        398 K/uL           [150-400]       NORMAL (high-normal)

** NOTE: First documented CBC for this patient. Hemoglobin 10.1 in a 25-year-old was attributed to "menstrual losses." The elevated RDW of 17.2% — indicating significant variation in red cell size (anisocytosis) — was not commented upon. No reticulocyte count, hemolysis labs, iron studies, or peripheral smear was ordered. **

** NOTE: No CBC ordered at this visit. Elevated ESR and CRP with a completely negative autoimmune panel should have prompted investigation into non-autoimmune inflammatory conditions — particularly hemolytic anemia. **

INDICATION: Acute pain crisis with fever. Comprehensive workup.

CBC:

  RDW:              18.5%              [11.5-14.5]      ** ELEVATED ** (worsening anisocytosis)
  Platelets:        425 K/uL           [150-400]       ** MILDLY ELEVATED ** (reactive thrombocytosis)
  WBC Differential:
    Neutrophils:    78%                [40-70]          HIGH (left shift — stress/infection)
    Lymphocytes:    14%                [20-40]          LOW (relative lymphopenia)
    Monocytes:      6%                 [2-8]            NORMAL
    Eosinophils:    1%                 [1-4]            NORMAL

  Reticulocyte Abs: 248 K/uL           [25-75]          ** MARKEDLY ELEVATED **

** CRITICAL: Reticulocyte count of 8% (absolute 248 K/uL) indicates massive bone marrow compensation for red cell destruction. This is 4x the upper limit of normal and is NOT seen in iron deficiency, nutritional deficiency, or anemia of chronic disease. This value alone confirms hemolytic anemia. **

  Indirect Bilirubin: 3.2 mg/dL        [0.1-1.0]       ** MARKEDLY ELEVATED **

  ** HEMOLYSIS PANEL INTERPRETATION:
     Elevated LDH           = Red cell destruction releasing intracellular enzyme
     Undetectable haptoglobin = Consumed by binding free hemoglobin from lysed RBCs

     ALL MARKERS CONCORDANT = INTRAVASCULAR + EXTRAVASCULAR HEMOLYSIS CONFIRMED **

COOMBS TEST:
  Direct Coombs (DAT):  NEGATIVE
  Indirect Coombs (IAT): NEGATIVE

** The entirely negative thrombophilia workup means the bilateral PE is "unprovoked" with no identifiable inherited or acquired clotting disorder. However, sickle cell disease is itself a hypercoagulable state — PE and in situ pulmonary arterial thrombosis are well-documented complications of SCD, occurring through mechanisms including chronic hemolysis-induced endothelial activation, nitric oxide depletion, platelet activation, and tissue factor exposure. The "unprovoked" PE is in fact provoked — by the undiagnosed sickle cell disease. **

  Ferritin:         185 ng/mL          [12-150]        ** HIGH-NORMAL TO MILDLY ELEVATED **

** CRITICAL: Iron studies are NORMAL. Ferritin is 185 — not depleted, and in fact above the upper limit of normal for premenopausal women. This patient is NOT iron deficient. Starting empiric iron supplementation was not indicated and does not address the cause of her anemia. Elevated ferritin in the setting of hemolytic anemia may reflect chronic hemolysis-related iron loading. Continued iron supplementation could lead to iron overload, particularly in sickle cell disease where chronic transfusion-independent iron accumulation is already a concern. **

PATTERN ANALYSIS — DIAGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE
================================================================

The following consistent laboratory pattern has been present across multiple time points:

HEMOLYSIS CONFIRMED (Coombs-negative):
- Persistent moderate anemia (Hgb 8.8-10.1)
- Markedly elevated reticulocyte count (7.2-8.0%) — vigorous marrow compensation
- Elevated LDH (342-380) — intracellular enzyme from RBC destruction
- Undetectable haptoglobin (<10) — consumed binding free hemoglobin
- Elevated indirect bilirubin (2.1-3.2) — hemoglobin breakdown product
- Negative Coombs test — NOT autoimmune hemolysis
- Elevated RDW (17.2-18.5%) — anisocytosis from mixed young and old RBC populations
- Normal MCV (86-88) — normocytic (consistent with HbSC or sickle-beta+ thalassemia)
- Normal iron studies with ferritin 185 — NOT iron deficient

CHRONIC INFLAMMATION:
- Persistently elevated ESR (38-62) and CRP (12-48)
- Reactive thrombocytosis (398-440)
- Negative autoimmune panel (ANA, RF, anti-CCP, HLA-B27)

HYPERCOAGULABILITY:
- Bilateral PE (unprovoked)
- Complete thrombophilia workup NEGATIVE
- The hypercoagulable state is caused by the undiagnosed hemolytic condition itself

NORMAL (ruling out other conditions):
- Iron studies normal — NOT iron deficiency
- Renal function normal — NOT renal failure-associated anemia
- TSH normal — NOT thyroid disease
- B12/folate not ordered but folic acid supplementation started empirically
- Hepatitis panel negative
- HIV negative

================================================================
TESTS NEVER ORDERED
================================================================

** The following critical diagnostic tests were NEVER ordered at any point during 3 years of care across 8 providers, despite documented Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, recurrent pain crises, bilateral medial malleolar leg ulcers, bilateral PE, African American ethnicity, and a brother with confirmed sickle cell disease:

1. HEMOGLOBIN ELECTROPHORESIS
   - The definitive diagnostic test for sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies
   - Would identify HbS, HbC, HbF percentages and confirm the specific variant
   - Widely available at all reference laboratories
   - Cost: approximately $25-50
   - Turnaround time: 2-5 business days
   - Should have been ordered at the FIRST documentation of hemolytic anemia

2. PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR
   - Would show target cells (characteristic of HbSC), sickle cells, Howell-Jolly bodies
   - A manual smear review was never requested despite 5 CBCs showing persistent anemia and elevated RDW
   - The automated CBC flagged "anisocytosis" but no pathologist review was triggered
   - Cost: $10-20

3. SICKLE CELL SCREEN (Sickledex / Sodium Metabisulfite Test)
   - Rapid point-of-care screening test for hemoglobin S
   - Result available in minutes to hours
   - Does not differentiate HbSS from HbSC or HbAS — requires electrophoresis for confirmation
   - Cost: $10-15

4. HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC)
   - Quantitative analysis of hemoglobin fractions
   - More precise than standard electrophoresis
   - Would definitively characterize the hemoglobinopathy variant
   - Cost: $50-100

5. SICKLING TEST UNDER HYPOXIC CONDITIONS
   - Demonstrates sickling morphology under controlled deoxygenation
   - Confirmatory for presence of HbS

Any ONE of the first four tests would have led to the diagnosis. Hemoglobin electrophoresis alone — a single blood draw, $25-50, no patient preparation required — would have ended 3 years of diagnostic odyssey, prevented bilateral PE and progressive leg ulcers, and connected this patient to comprehensive sickle cell disease care including hydroxyurea, pain crisis protocols, and disease-modifying therapy. **

SUMMARY
================================================================
Nina Okafor's laboratory data demonstrates a clear, unambiguous, and persistent pattern of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia: moderate normocytic anemia (Hgb 8.8-10.1), markedly elevated reticulocytes (8%), elevated LDH (380), undetectable haptoglobin (<10), elevated indirect bilirubin (2.1), negative Coombs, elevated RDW (18.5%), reactive thrombocytosis (425), and normal iron studies (ferritin 185). Combined with chronically elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 45, CRP 18), a completely negative autoimmune and thrombophilia workup, bilateral PE, and clinical features of recurrent pain crises and bilateral medial malleolar ulcers — the laboratory profile is diagnostic of a hemoglobinopathy, most likely sickle cell disease (HbSC or sickle-beta thalassemia variant given normocytic indices and relatively mild baseline anemia). The hemolysis markers were in the chart for over 12 months. They were documented by multiple providers. They were never synthesized.
