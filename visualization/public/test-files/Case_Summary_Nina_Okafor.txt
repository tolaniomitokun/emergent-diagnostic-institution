28-year-old African American female graphic designer presenting with 3-year history of episodic severe pain crises affecting multiple body regions, chronic joint pain, recurrent non-healing leg ulcers at medial malleoli, unprovoked bilateral pulmonary embolism, and chronic hemolytic anemia with markers documented in the medical record for over 12 months but never synthesized into a unifying diagnosis. Classic undiagnosed Sickle Cell Disease (likely HbSC or sickle-beta thalassemia variant) with fragmented care across 8 providers over 3 years.

3 years ago: First acute pain crisis — sudden onset of severe bilateral lower back and hip pain, 9/10 intensity, described as "deep bone pain like nothing I've ever felt." Presented to Mercy Regional Medical Center ER at 2:00 AM. Unable to find a comfortable position. IV morphine 4mg x2 required for partial relief. CT abdomen/pelvis performed to evaluate for renal pathology — normal, no kidney stone identified. Urinalysis unremarkable. No CBC drawn. No peripheral smear. Pain attributed to "acute musculoskeletal pain, possible kidney stone that passed prior to imaging." Discharged with hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 #15 and ibuprofen. No follow-up arranged. Patient missed 5 days of work. Pain resolved gradually over 6 days.

2.5 years ago: Second acute pain crisis — severe bilateral arm pain and chest wall pain, radiating to sternum. 8/10 intensity. Presented to same ER. Tachycardic (HR 108) with mild fever (100.4F). Troponin negative x2. ECG: sinus tachycardia, otherwise normal. CT chest without contrast: no rib fractures, no pneumothorax, no consolidation, no PE (contrast not administered — not PE protocol). CBC drawn at this visit: Hgb 10.1, MCV 86, WBC 11.2 (attributed to pain/stress response), platelets 398. Hemoglobin of 10.1 documented but attributed to "likely menstrual losses — recommend iron supplementation and PCP follow-up." Diagnosed "costochondritis and anxiety" with notation "patient appears very anxious about pain, recommend relaxation techniques." Pain managed with ketorolac IV then oral naproxen. Discharged with naproxen, low-dose diazepam PRN #10. No sickle cell screening. No reticulocyte count. No hemolysis labs. Patient reports she "felt dismissed" at this visit and the nurse told her "honey, you need to learn to manage your stress."

2 years ago: Referred to rheumatology by PCP for "chronic pain syndrome — evaluate for autoimmune etiology." Rheumatology consultation with Dr. L. Greenfield. Comprehensive autoimmune workup: ANA negative, RF negative, anti-CCP negative, HLA-B27 negative. ESR 38 mm/hr (elevated), CRP 12 mg/L (elevated). Uric acid 5.8 (normal). X-rays of hands, hips, SI joints — no erosive changes, no sacroiliitis. Dr. Greenfield noted "significant pain out of proportion to physical examination findings" and diagnosed fibromyalgia. Started duloxetine 30mg daily, titrated to 60mg. Recommended exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy. No investigation into the cause of elevated inflammatory markers with negative autoimmune panel. No CBC ordered at rheumatology visit.

18 months ago: Developed painful ulcer on left medial malleolus. Initially treated with topical antibiotics by PCP Dr. P. Nakamura. Failed to heal after 6 weeks. Referred to dermatology. Dr. M. Cho performed punch biopsy: "nonspecific ulceration with perivascular inflammation and hemosiderin deposition. No vasculitis. No malignancy." Wound culture: mixed skin flora, no predominant pathogen. ABI (ankle-brachial index): 1.08 bilateral (normal — no peripheral arterial disease). Venous duplex: no deep venous insufficiency, no superficial reflux. Dr. Cho diagnosed "nonspecific lower extremity ulceration of unclear etiology" and started compression therapy with weekly wound care.

12 months ago: Third and most severe pain crisis — acute onset diffuse bone pain (back, chest, bilateral legs), fever 102.2F, rigors. Presented to ER, admitted to hospital under Dr. K. Rivera (hospitalist). Four-day hospitalization. Blood cultures x2 negative. CT chest with PE protocol on hospital day 2 for persistent tachycardia and pleuritic component: BILATERAL PULMONARY EMBOLISM — segmental clots in right lower lobe and left lower lobe pulmonary arteries. Started on IV heparin, transitioned to apixaban (Eliquis). Hematology consulted (Dr. J. Walsh) for hypercoagulability workup in the setting of unprovoked bilateral PE in a young woman. Full thrombophilia panel: Factor V Leiden negative, prothrombin gene mutation negative, antithrombin III normal, protein C normal, protein S normal, antiphospholipid antibodies negative (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM negative, beta-2 glycoprotein IgG/IgM negative, lupus anticoagulant negative). Hematologist's conclusion: "No identifiable hereditary or acquired thrombophilia. Recommend indefinite anticoagulation given unprovoked bilateral PE."

CRITICAL: During this hospitalization, the following hemolysis markers were documented in the medical record:
  - LDH: 380 U/L [normal 140-280] — ELEVATED
  - Haptoglobin: <10 mg/dL [normal 30-200] — UNDETECTABLE
  - Reticulocyte count: 8.0% [normal 0.5-2.0] — MARKEDLY ELEVATED
  - Indirect bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL [normal 0.1-1.0] — ELEVATED
  - Direct Coombs test: NEGATIVE
  - Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL — MODERATE ANEMIA

These results constitute a classic Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia picture. They were ordered as part of the anemia workup during hospitalization but were never synthesized with the clinical presentation. The hematology consultant focused exclusively on the thrombophilia workup and did not address the hemolytic anemia. The hospitalist documented the lab results but attributed the anemia to "anemia of chronic disease" in the discharge summary. No hemoglobin electrophoresis, peripheral blood smear, or sickle cell screen was ordered.

8 months ago: New ulcer developed on right medial malleolus — mirror image of left-sided ulcer. Returned to Dr. M. Cho (dermatology). Biopsy: "findings similar to prior specimen — nonspecific ulceration with dermal hemosiderin." At this visit, patient mentioned that her older brother "has some kind of blood problem — he gets pain episodes too and was in the hospital a lot as a kid." This family history was documented in the dermatology note but not communicated to other providers or flagged as diagnostically significant.

6 months ago: PCP follow-up with Dr. P. Nakamura. Dr. Nakamura reviewed hospitalization records and noted the hemolysis markers. Progress note reads: "Reviewed prior hospitalization labs — LDH elevated, haptoglobin undetectable, reticulocytes elevated, indirect bilirubin elevated, Coombs negative. Pattern consistent with hemolysis. Hemoglobin 9.2 today. Will start ferrous sulfate 325mg daily to address anemia." Started empiric iron supplementation. No hemoglobin electrophoresis ordered. No referral to hematology for hemolytic anemia evaluation. No peripheral blood smear. Ferritin at this visit was 185 ng/mL — NOT consistent with iron deficiency. The iron supplementation was therefore not indicated and not addressing the actual cause of anemia.

Current presentation: Chronic pain in joints and bones, described as a baseline "aching" at 4-5/10 with intermittent acute flares reaching 8-10/10 every 4-8 weeks. Two active non-healing ulcers at bilateral medial malleoli. On duloxetine 60mg daily (for fibromyalgia diagnosis), apixaban 5mg BID (for bilateral PE), hydrocodone/acetaminophen PRN (rarely used — "doesn't help much"), and ferrous sulfate 325mg daily (inappropriately prescribed — not iron deficient). Patient reports significant impact on quality of life — unable to exercise, difficulty meeting graphic design deadlines during pain flares, social isolation due to chronic pain and visible leg ulcers. Reports feeling "gaslit" by the medical system: "Everyone tells me it's stress or fibromyalgia or in my head, but something is really wrong with me."

Laboratory summary (most recent, 6 months ago): Hgb 9.2 g/dL (moderate anemia), MCV 88 fL (normocytic), RDW 18.5% (elevated — anisocytosis), reticulocyte count 8.0% (markedly elevated), LDH 380 U/L (elevated), haptoglobin <10 mg/dL (undetectable), indirect bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL (elevated), direct Coombs negative, ESR 45 mm/hr (elevated), CRP 18 mg/L (elevated), ferritin 185 ng/mL (normal — NOT iron deficient), platelets 425 K/uL (mildly elevated — reactive thrombocytosis), WBC 9.8 K/uL (normal).

8 providers seen over 3 years: ER physician visit 1 (Dr. T. Morrison), ER physician visit 2 (Dr. A. Patel), Rheumatologist (Dr. L. Greenfield), Dermatologist (Dr. M. Cho, 2 visits), Hospitalist (Dr. K. Rivera), Hematologist (Dr. J. Walsh — consulted for PE/thrombophilia only), PCP (Dr. P. Nakamura). Each provider evaluated their own piece of the clinical picture in isolation. No provider synthesized the constellation of recurrent severe pain crises + Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia + non-healing leg ulcers at medial malleoli + unprovoked bilateral PE + African American ethnicity + brother with "blood problems" into the unifying diagnosis of sickle cell disease.

The diagnosis is sickle cell disease — likely HbSC disease or sickle-beta thalassemia, given the relatively mild baseline anemia and normocytic (rather than microcytic) indices, later age of clinical presentation, and absence of childhood diagnosis. These variant forms of sickle cell disease are frequently missed because they do not present with the severe childhood crises typical of homozygous HbSS disease. However, they cause identical complications: vaso-occlusive pain crises, chronic hemolytic anemia, leg ulcers (especially at the medial malleolus), and in situ pulmonary thrombosis/PE. A single hemoglobin electrophoresis — a widely available, inexpensive test — would confirm the diagnosis and redirect all care.
