PCP referral notes: "Patient has had two ER visits (02/2023, 08/2023) for acute severe pain — first back/hips, then chest/arms. ER workups negative for acute pathology. Diagnosed musculoskeletal pain and costochondritis. Reports ongoing baseline joint aching between acute flares. Ibuprofen provides modest relief. No family history of autoimmune disease per PCP records. Prior labs: Hgb 10.1 on 08/2023 CBC (attributed to menstrual losses)."

================================
RHEUMATOLOGY EVALUATION
================================

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Nina is a 26-year-old African American female graphic designer referred for evaluation of chronic pain. She describes a pattern of intermittent severe pain "attacks" over the past 12-14 months superimposed on a chronic daily baseline of diffuse aching.

Pain episodes: She reports two major episodes that brought her to the ER — the first affecting her lower back and hips (02/2023), the second affecting her chest and arms (08/2023). She describes both episodes as sudden onset, reaching peak severity within 1-2 hours, and lasting 4-7 days before gradually resolving. The pain is deep, aching, and "bone-level." She rates these episodes 8-9/10 in severity. She reports several smaller episodes in between (bilateral knees, left shoulder, ribs) that she managed at home with ibuprofen and heating pads, lasting 2-4 days each.

Baseline symptoms: Between acute episodes, she describes constant low-grade aching at 4-5/10 in her hips, knees, lower back, and occasionally her shoulders and hands. Morning stiffness lasting approximately 15-20 minutes. No clear diurnal pattern. Pain does not clearly improve or worsen with activity.

Associated symptoms: Chronic fatigue — present for approximately 1 year, progressive, significantly impacting work productivity. Intermittent low-grade fevers during pain flares. No weight loss. No rashes. No photosensitivity. No dry eyes or dry mouth. No oral ulcers. No Raynaud phenomenon. No hair loss. No dyspnea. Reports occasional mild shortness of breath with exertion but attributes this to deconditioning.

She reports that the second ER visit was "humiliating" — she was told her pain was anxiety-related and was prescribed diazepam. She states: "I know my body. This pain is real. Something is wrong and nobody can figure it out."

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Anemia (Hgb 10.1, 08/2023) — attributed to menstrual losses
- Two ER visits for acute pain (02/2023, 08/2023)
- No childhood chronic illness
- No history of blood transfusions
- No history of jaundice (patient denies, though scleral icterus was documented at 08/2023 ER visit)

SURGICAL HISTORY: None
MEDICATIONS: Ibuprofen 400-600mg PRN (takes 3-4 times per week)
ALLERGIES: NKDA

FAMILY HISTORY:
- Mother: Hypertension, type 2 diabetes. Alive, age 54.
- Father: Hypertension. Alive, age 58.
- Brother (older, age 30): "He was sick a lot as a kid — something with his blood. He still gets pain sometimes." Patient unable to provide specific diagnosis.
- No family history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or psoriasis per patient.

** NOTE: The brother's history of childhood illness involving "something with his blood" and recurrent pain episodes is highly suggestive of sickle cell disease. This family history was documented but its diagnostic significance was not recognized. **

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Graphic designer, works from home. Non-smoker. Occasional alcohol (1-2 drinks per week, avoids during pain flares). No illicit drug use. Single. Born and raised in Atlanta, GA. Both parents of Nigerian descent.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional: Fatigue (chronic), intermittent low-grade fevers during pain episodes. No weight loss.
HEENT: No dry eyes or mouth. No visual changes. No oral ulcers.
CV: No chest pain at present. No palpitations. Occasional mild exertional dyspnea.
Pulmonary: No cough. No hemoptysis.
GI: No abdominal pain. No diarrhea. No dysphagia.
GU: Regular menses. Reports heavy periods lasting 5-6 days.
MSK: See HPI. Diffuse pain. No joint swelling noted by patient.
Skin: No rashes. No photosensitivity. Reports occasional "yellowish" tint to eyes — "my mom has it too, I thought it was just hereditary."
Neuro: No headaches. No numbness. No tingling.
Psych: Anxiety related to undiagnosed pain condition. No depression per patient. Frustrated with medical system.

** NOTE: Patient reported occasional yellowing of her eyes, which she considered a familial trait. This casual mention of intermittent scleral icterus — combined with the brother's "blood problems" — should have been a red flag for a hereditary hemolytic condition. It was documented in the review of systems but not pursued. **

  Bilateral lateral epicondyle: - / -
  Bilateral gluteal:           + / +
  Bilateral greater trochanter: + / +
  Bilateral medial knee:       + / +
  TOTAL: 16 of 18 tender points positive

** NOTE: The physician documented 16/18 positive tender points and used this to support a fibromyalgia diagnosis. However, diffuse bony tenderness is also a feature of sickle cell disease due to chronic bone marrow ischemia and infarction. The "tender points" in this patient may represent sites of prior vaso-occlusive crises rather than the central sensitization of fibromyalgia. The phrase "pain out of proportion to exam findings" — used repeatedly in this patient's records — is in fact a hallmark description of vaso-occlusive pain in sickle cell disease. **

ASSESSMENT:
"This is a 26-year-old woman with a 12-14 month history of episodic severe pain with diffuse baseline aching, chronic fatigue, and 16/18 positive fibromyalgia tender points. The pain out of proportion to physical examination findings, the absence of objective synovitis or joint damage, and the widespread tender points are consistent with fibromyalgia. Autoimmune markers are negative (see below). I do not find evidence of an inflammatory arthropathy, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, or connective tissue disease at this time."

================================
LABORATORY RESULTS
================================
Ordered at this visit:

AUTOIMMUNE PANEL:
  ANA:                  Negative (titer <1:40)
  Rheumatoid Factor:    <10 IU/mL          [<14]        NEGATIVE
  Anti-CCP:             <3 U/mL            [<20]        NEGATIVE
  HLA-B27:              NEGATIVE

INFLAMMATORY MARKERS:
  ESR:                  38 mm/hr           [0-20]       ** ELEVATED **
  CRP:                  12 mg/L            [<3.0]       ** ELEVATED **

METABOLIC:
  Uric Acid:            5.8 mg/dL          [2.4-6.0]    NORMAL
  25-OH Vitamin D:      22 ng/mL           [30-100]     ** LOW ** (insufficiency)
  TSH:                  2.6 mIU/L          [0.4-4.0]    NORMAL
  Magnesium:            1.9 mg/dL          [1.7-2.2]    NORMAL

** NOTE: No CBC was ordered at this rheumatology visit. No hemolysis markers. No iron studies. The elevated ESR (38) and CRP (12) in the setting of a completely negative autoimmune panel should have prompted investigation into non-autoimmune causes of chronic inflammation. In a young African American woman with recurrent pain crises, hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation for chronically elevated inflammatory markers with negative autoimmune serologies. **

IMAGING (ordered at this visit):
X-ray bilateral hands (PA): No erosions. No periarticular osteopenia. Joint spaces preserved. Normal soft tissues. Unremarkable.

X-ray pelvis AP: Bilateral hip joints normal. No avascular necrosis. No sacroiliac joint abnormality. No erosions. No sclerosis. Femoral heads round and well-seated. Unremarkable.

X-ray bilateral SI joints (dedicated views): No sclerosis. No erosion. No widening or fusion. No evidence of sacroiliitis. Grade 0 bilaterally.

================================
DIAGNOSES
================================
1. Fibromyalgia — based on widespread pain index and symptom severity score meeting 2010 ACR fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria. 16/18 tender points meeting 1990 criteria.
2. Vitamin D insufficiency — may contribute to diffuse musculoskeletal pain.
3. Chronic fatigue — likely fibromyalgia-related.
4. Mild anemia (per prior records) — recommend PCP follow-up for iron studies.
5. Elevated ESR/CRP — may be related to an acute pain flare or chronic low-grade inflammation associated with fibromyalgia (atypical but reported in literature).

================================
TREATMENT PLAN
================================
1. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 30mg daily x 2 weeks, then increase to 60mg daily — first-line pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia.
2. Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily.
3. Recommended: regular aerobic exercise (low-impact — swimming, walking, cycling), starting with 15 minutes daily and gradually increasing.
4. Recommended: cognitive behavioral therapy for pain management and coping strategies. Provided referral to Dr. S. Williams (psychologist specializing in chronic pain).
5. Sleep hygiene counseling provided. Consider sleep study if symptoms persist.
6. Discontinue ibuprofen — NSAIDs have limited efficacy in fibromyalgia and chronic use increases GI and renal risk.
7. Follow-up in 3 months to assess duloxetine response.
8. PCP to address anemia workup and iron supplementation.

================================
FOLLOW-UP NOTE — 2024-05-15 (3 months later)
================================
INTERVAL HISTORY:
Nina returns for follow-up. She has been taking duloxetine 60mg daily for approximately 2 months. She reports modest improvement in baseline pain (5/10 down to 3-4/10) and improved sleep quality. She has been walking 20 minutes daily most days.

However, she reports two additional acute pain flares since her last visit — one affecting her right hip and thigh (lasted 5 days), one affecting her left chest and ribs (lasted 3 days). She managed both at home with acetaminophen and heating pads. She did not return to the ER.

She also reports a new problem: a "sore" on her left ankle that appeared 3 weeks ago and has not healed. It is tender and mildly draining. She shows me the area — there is a shallow ulcer approximately 2 cm in diameter over the left medial malleolus, with fibrinous base and mild surrounding erythema. No purulence.

She mentions: "My brother says his leg ulcers looked just like this when he was younger."

EXAM:
General: Appears slightly more fatigued than prior visit. Mildly pale.
Left ankle: Shallow ulcer, 2 x 1.5 cm, over left medial malleolus. Fibrinous base. Mild erythema surrounding. No purulence. No warmth beyond immediate wound margin. Pedal pulses 2+ bilaterally. No edema.

UPDATED ASSESSMENT:
1. Fibromyalgia — partial response to duloxetine. Continue current dose.
2. Recurrent acute pain flares — concerning for breakthrough despite treatment. Consider pregabalin as adjunct if persistent.
3. Left medial malleolus ulcer — uncertain etiology in a young woman. Referred to dermatology (Dr. M. Cho) for evaluation and biopsy.
4. Continue vitamin D supplementation.

** NOTE: The patient mentioned her brother had similar leg ulcers. The connection between her brother's "blood problems," his leg ulcers, and her own identical presentation at the medial malleolus was not made. **

RETROSPECTIVE ADDENDUM
================================
Added by: Dr. L. Greenfield, MD, FACR
Date: 2026-02-08

Upon learning that Nina Okafor has subsequently been found to have Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia with laboratory markers consistent with sickle cell disease (hemoglobin electrophoresis pending), I must critically re-examine my evaluation:

1. ELEVATED INFLAMMATORY MARKERS WITH NEGATIVE AUTOIMMUNE PANEL: ESR 38 and CRP 12 in the context of a completely negative autoimmune workup (ANA, RF, anti-CCP, HLA-B27 all negative) should have prompted me to ask: what is causing chronic inflammation in this young woman? Fibromyalgia is NOT an inflammatory condition — it should not cause elevated ESR and CRP. I documented these elevated markers and attributed them to fibromyalgia, which was diagnostically lazy. The true cause was chronic hemolysis and ongoing vaso-occlusive tissue injury from sickle cell disease.

2. "PAIN OUT OF PROPORTION TO EXAM FINDINGS": I used this phrase to support a fibromyalgia diagnosis. In retrospect, this phrase is one of the most recognized clinical descriptors of vaso-occlusive pain crises in sickle cell disease. The very feature I interpreted as supporting a functional pain syndrome was in fact a hallmark of the actual diagnosis. Sickle cell pain crises produce excruciating pain with minimal or no external signs of inflammation, swelling, or joint damage — precisely the presentation I documented.

3. FIBROMYALGIA AS A DIAGNOSIS OF EXCLUSION: Fibromyalgia should only be diagnosed after ruling out conditions that can mimic it. I did not order a CBC, reticulocyte count, hemolysis markers, or hemoglobin electrophoresis. I failed to rule out hemolytic anemia as a cause of chronic bone and joint pain. A basic CBC would have revealed anemia and elevated RDW, prompting further workup.

4. FAMILY HISTORY OF "BLOOD PROBLEMS": The patient's brother had childhood illness involving "something with his blood" and recurrent pain episodes. At the follow-up visit, she reported he also had leg ulcers similar to hers. Both parents are of Nigerian descent. Nigeria has one of the highest sickle cell prevalence rates in the world. This family history, combined with the clinical presentation, should have made sickle cell disease my leading differential.

5. INTERMITTENT SCLERAL ICTERUS: The patient mentioned "yellowish" tint to her eyes that she considered a family trait. I did not examine for scleral icterus, and I did not recognize this as a symptom of chronic hemolysis.

6. PATTERN OF MIGRATORY PAIN CRISES: Pain affecting different anatomical regions on different occasions — back/hips, chest/arms, knees, ribs — is the textbook presentation of vaso-occlusive crises. I interpreted this as the diffuse, non-anatomical pain pattern of fibromyalgia rather than the shifting pattern of microvascular occlusion.

This case represents a fundamental failure of pattern recognition. A young African American woman with recurrent severe pain crises, chronic anemia, elevated inflammatory markers, intermittent jaundice, leg ulcers at the medial malleolus, and a brother with "blood problems" and similar leg ulcers — this constellation should have prompted sickle cell screening before any consideration of fibromyalgia.
