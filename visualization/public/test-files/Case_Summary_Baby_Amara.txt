4-month-old female infant, born full-term via normal vaginal delivery at 7 lbs 2 oz (3.23 kg), presenting with progressive failure to thrive, tachypnea, feeding intolerance, diaphoresis during feeds, and perioral cyanosis. Undiagnosed large perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD, 8mm) causing congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive. Seen by 4 providers across 7 encounters over 4 months before cardiac evaluation was performed.

Birth and Newborn Period: Baby Amara was born at 39+2 weeks via uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old G1P1 mother. Birth weight 7 lbs 2 oz (3.23 kg, 50th percentile), length 20 inches (50.8 cm, 55th percentile), head circumference 34.5 cm (60th percentile). APGARs 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Newborn screen normal. Passed hearing screen bilaterally. No congenital anomalies noted. Routine newborn exam by OB/GYN Dr. J. Washington documented "normal heart sounds, no murmur, femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally." Discharged at 48 hours in good condition. Breastfeeding initiated in hospital, reportedly latching well with lactation support.

2 weeks of age: Parents present to pediatrician Dr. P. Nakamura for first well-child visit. Mother reports infant "breathes really fast, especially during and after feeds." Weight 3.45 kg (35th percentile — already declining from birth). RR documented at 48 breaths/min at rest (upper limit of normal for neonates). Parents reassured that "newborns breathe differently" and that periodic rapid breathing is normal. Heart exam documented as "regular rate and rhythm, no murmur appreciated." No further investigation. In retrospect, this was the earliest documented symptom of what would prove to be increasing pulmonary blood flow from the left-to-right shunt through the VSD. As PVR was still dropping in the neonatal period, the shunt was increasing and symptoms were already beginning.

1 month of age: Second well-child visit. Mother reports infant seems to "work hard to breathe" during feeds and takes longer to finish (30-40 minutes per feed vs. 15-20 minutes initially). Weight 3.72 kg (30th percentile — continued decline). RR documented at 55 breaths/min, which was attributed to the infant being "fussy and crying during exam." HR 152 bpm. Heart auscultation: "Regular rate, no murmur, no gallop." Weight gain flagged as "slightly below expected" but considered within acceptable range. Feeding counseling provided. No further workup.

2 months of age: Well-child visit. Significant milestone — weight has dropped from 50th percentile at birth to 15th percentile. Weight 4.1 kg. Mother reports feeds are increasingly difficult. Infant becomes "very sweaty" during breastfeeding, appears to tire after only 2-3 minutes of active sucking, and sometimes falls asleep at the breast before taking adequate volume. Mother reports feeds now take 40-50 minutes with frequent pauses. Infant appears to have increased work of breathing during feeds. RR 52. HR 156. Heart exam: "No murmur appreciated." Diagnosis documented as "poor latch technique, possibly contributing to inadequate caloric intake." Referral placed to lactation consultant. Immunizations given. Growth chart reviewed — Dr. Nakamura notes the percentile decline but attributes it to feeding difficulties.

2.5 months of age: Lactation consultation with Sarah Mitchell, IBCLC, at Mother & Baby Lactation Center. This encounter represents the critical missed pivot point. Mitchell performs a comprehensive feeding assessment including a weighted feed. She documents that the infant has a good latch, maternal milk supply is adequate (pumped volume 150mL per session), and the weighted feed shows 85mL intake in 25 minutes — a reasonable volume but achieved with significant effort. The key finding: Mitchell documents that the infant demonstrates tachypnea (RR 58-62 during feeds), diaphoresis (visible scalp and forehead sweating), nasal flaring, and marked fatigue after 2-3 minutes of active sucking, requiring prolonged rest periods. She explicitly states in her note: "This baby fatigues abnormally during feeds. The feeding pattern — initial vigorous suck followed by rapid exhaustion, tachypnea, and diaphoresis — is NOT consistent with a latch or supply problem. This pattern is more consistent with increased metabolic demand or cardiopulmonary compromise. I strongly recommend cardiopulmonary evaluation before continued focus on feeding interventions." This recommendation was faxed to Dr. Nakamura's office. It was received but not acted upon urgently. A follow-up feeding appointment was scheduled instead.

3 months of age: Well-child visit. Weight now 4.2 kg — below 5th percentile. Length growth also slowing. Head circumference relatively preserved (suggesting caloric deprivation affecting somatic growth more than brain growth, as is typical in failure to thrive). Mother is now tearful, reports infant "barely eats" and she is supplementing with expressed breast milk via bottle. RR 58. HR 160. Subcostal retractions noted. Heart auscultation: "Possible soft murmur vs. transmitted breath sounds, uncertain. No definite murmur." CXR ordered due to persistent tachypnea. Results: "Mild cardiomegaly, possibly a normal variant in this age group. No focal infiltrate. No effusion." This CXR finding — cardiomegaly in an infant with tachypnea, failure to thrive, and feeding difficulty — should have triggered an immediate echocardiogram. Instead, it was read as "possibly normal variant" and no follow-up was arranged. Diagnosis at this visit: "Failure to thrive, likely multifactorial. Possible feeding aversion." Plan: increase caloric density of expressed breast milk, add formula supplementation, nutrition follow-up in 2 weeks.

3.5 months of age: Emergency department visit at Community Children's Hospital. Parents bring infant in for "respiratory infection" — 2 days of increased breathing difficulty, worsened feeding, and a low-grade fever (37.4C). Triage: ESI Level 3. HR 158, RR 62, SpO2 95%, Temp 37.4C, Weight 4.15 kg (has lost weight since last visit). ER physician Dr. A. Reyes evaluates. RSV and influenza rapid tests negative. CXR performed: "Cardiomegaly with cardiothoracic ratio approximately 0.56-0.58. Increased pulmonary vascular markings. Perihilar haziness bilaterally." These findings — cardiomegaly plus increased pulmonary vascularity plus perihilar haziness — are the classic radiographic signature of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema, not viral pneumonia. However, the CXR is read in the context of the chief complaint ("respiratory infection") and interpreted as "possible viral lower respiratory process vs. atelectasis." Physical exam documents hepatomegaly — liver palpated 3cm below right costal margin — but this finding is attributed to "examiner variation, possibly normal in young infant" rather than recognized as right-sided heart failure. Discharge diagnosis: "Viral upper respiratory infection." Amoxicillin prescribed. Follow-up with pediatrician in 3-5 days. No cardiac evaluation recommended. In retrospect, the combination of cardiomegaly on CXR, increased pulmonary vascular markings, hepatomegaly, tachypnea, tachycardia, SpO2 95%, and failure to thrive in a 3.5-month-old should have prompted an emergent echocardiogram and pediatric cardiology consultation.

4 months of age: Well-child visit — the diagnostic breakthrough. Weight 4.1 kg — the infant has now LOST weight, dropping below the 3rd percentile. Mother reports the infant turns blue around the mouth during feeds. Perioral cyanosis is witnessed in the office during an attempted feed. HR 165, RR 64, SpO2 94% on room air. For the first time, a clear grade II/VI holosystolic murmur is heard at the left lower sternal border with radiation to the right. S2 is loud (suggesting pulmonary hypertension). The precordium is hyperactive. Subcostal retractions are present. Fine crackles are heard at bilateral lung bases. Liver is palpated 3cm below the right costal margin. The murmur — likely present for weeks if not longer but potentially masked by tachycardia, crying, and incomplete auscultation at prior visits — is now unmistakable. STAT echocardiogram is arranged. BNP drawn: 485 pg/mL (markedly elevated, confirming significant heart failure).

Echocardiogram findings: Large 8mm perimembranous ventricular septal defect with left-to-right shunting. Left atrium and left ventricle dilated (LA:Ao ratio 2.1). Estimated right ventricular systolic pressure 45 mmHg (moderate pulmonary hypertension). Moderate mitral regurgitation secondary to annular dilation. LV systolic function preserved but at the lower end of normal (EF 58%). Normal aortic arch. Normal systemic and pulmonary venous return.

Final diagnosis: Large perimembranous ventricular septal defect with congestive heart failure, moderate pulmonary hypertension, moderate secondary mitral regurgitation, and severe failure to thrive. Urgent referral to pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiothoracic surgery for evaluation of surgical VSD closure vs. initial medical management of heart failure (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, caloric supplementation).

Diagnostic timeline: 4 months from first symptoms to diagnosis. 7 clinical encounters across 4 providers. Key missed opportunities: (1) Persistent tachypnea from 2 weeks of age not investigated. (2) Progressive failure to thrive with feeding difficulty not connected to cardiac etiology. (3) Lactation consultant's explicit recommendation for cardiopulmonary evaluation at 2.5 months not urgently acted upon — the one provider who correctly identified the problem. (4) CXR showing cardiomegaly at 3 months dismissed as "normal variant." (5) ER visit at 3.5 months with cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascularity, hepatomegaly, and tachypnea attributed to viral URI. (6) Murmur potentially present earlier but not detected due to tachycardia, crying, or insufficient auscultation technique in the infant.

This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge of congenital heart disease presenting primarily as failure to thrive and feeding difficulty. VSDs may not produce an audible murmur in the newborn period when pulmonary vascular resistance is still elevated. As PVR drops in the first weeks to months of life, the left-to-right shunt increases, leading to volume overload, pulmonary overcirculation, and congestive heart failure. The "feeding difficulty" is actually the infant's inability to sustain the metabolic demands of feeding while in heart failure — a presentation often misattributed to latch problems, supply issues, or feeding aversion.
