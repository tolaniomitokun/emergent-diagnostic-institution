CRITICAL VALUES CALLED TO:
Dr. R. Kapoor at 14:47 — Potassium 2.8, Calcium 12.4

NOTES:
- Triad of hypercalcemia + hypophosphatemia + elevated Alk Phos strongly suggests primary hyperparathyroidism
- Suppressed TSH with elevated Free T4 and Free T3 confirms thyrotoxicosis
- Concurrent parathyroid and thyroid pathology in a 17-year-old: consider MEN syndrome (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia)
- Recommend endocrinology URGENT consult
- Potassium replacement initiated: 40 mEq KCl IV over 4 hours
- Cardiac monitoring ordered given hypokalemia + thyrotoxicosis
