52-year-old male farmer presenting with 2-year history of progressive cognitive decline, bilateral intention tremor, personality changes, and multisystem deterioration.

2 years ago: Wife first notices memory difficulties — forgetting tool locations, repeating questions. Attributed to work stress. 20 months ago: Got lost driving to feed store he's visited weekly for 20 years. PCP ordered TSH, B12, RPR (all normal). Diagnosed depression, started sertraline. No cognitive screening performed. No occupational exposure history taken. 16 months ago: Onset of bilateral hand tremor, initially intermittent. Increasing irritability, emotional outbursts, social withdrawal from church and community. 14 months ago: Neurology consultation. MMSE 21/30. MRI brain: mild generalized cortical atrophy. Neurologist diagnosed "probable early-onset Alzheimer's disease." Started donepezil. Tremor attributed to "essential tremor, possibly anxiety-related." No occupational history taken. 12 months ago: Neuropsychological evaluation. MoCA 18/30. Deficits in memory, executive function, attention, visuospatial processing. Neuropsychologist noted profile "consistent with early-onset AD, though prominent executive dysfunction and attention deficits are somewhat atypical." No alternative etiologies suggested. 10 months ago: GI consultation for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, 18-lb weight loss. CT abdomen: mild hepatomegaly, diverticula. Endoscopy/colonoscopy: mild gastritis, diverticulosis. Diagnosed "functional abdominal pain, IBS-C, mild NAFLD." GI symptoms attributed to stress. No connection made to neurological picture. 8 months ago: EMG/NCS showed mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy bilateral lower extremities. Attributed to "diabetic neuropathy" despite well-controlled HbA1c 6.4% and only 5 years of DM2. 6 months ago: Dentist documented bluish-gray line along gingival margin — diagnosed as "chronic periodontal disease with pigmentation changes." Did not recognize Burton line. No medical referral. 4 months ago: PCP follow-up. Unable to operate farm equipment, needs help dressing, nocturnal wandering. CBC: microcytic anemia (Hgb 11.8, MCV 76). Iron studies: low serum iron, high TIBC. Started iron supplementation. No peripheral smear ordered. No investigation beyond iron deficiency. No re-evaluation of Alzheimer's diagnosis despite atypically rapid progression. Current: Wife seeks second opinion. Patient needs assistance with all ADLs, bilateral intention tremor interfering with self-feeding, chronic constipation, 26-lb total weight loss. Exam notable for Burton line (blue-gray gingival line), bilateral wrist drop, thenar and interosseous muscle wasting, wide-based unsteady gait, foot drop, stocking-glove sensory loss.

CRITICAL OCCUPATIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY (never previously elicited): Farmer for 30 years, applies pesticides/herbicides without consistent respiratory protection or gloves. Maintains 1940s-era barn with peeling paint — scrapes and repaints himself without mask. Property uses 60-year-old well for drinking water, downstream from former industrial site. Well water has always "tasted metallic." No well water testing ever performed.

Labs: Microcytic anemia (Hgb 11.8, MCV 76, high RDW), elevated reticulocyte count 2.8%, low serum iron with high TIBC, mildly elevated creatinine 1.4 (eGFR 58), elevated uric acid 8.2, mildly elevated bilirubin 1.3, trace proteinuria, elevated ESR 28. NO HEAVY METAL TESTING HAS EVER BEEN ORDERED.

Prior diagnoses: early-onset Alzheimer's disease, depression, essential tremor, IBS/functional abdominal pain, diabetic neuropathy, NAFLD, iron deficiency anemia, periodontal disease. 5 providers seen over 2 years. Family history: NO family history of dementia or neurodegenerative disease. Father died at 78 of heart disease, mother alive at 80.
