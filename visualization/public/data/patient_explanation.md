# Your Answers About Eli: What We Found

Dear Mrs. Reeves,

After looking at everything in your binder — all 12 years of it, from 8 different doctors across 3 states — we finally have your answers. You were right to keep pushing. You were right to keep that binder. And most importantly: **someone already found the answer 3 years ago, but it got lost.**

## What We Found

Eli has a condition called **CLN2 disease**. It's also known as late-infantile Batten disease. This is a genetic condition where his brain cells can't break down certain waste products, so they build up and damage his brain over time.

**The most important thing:** Dr. Amara Osei at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio already diagnosed this in April 2021. She ran the right test, got the right answer, and started planning treatment. But when your family moved to North Carolina, those medical records got lost in the military transfer system.

Your thick binder had better records than the military medical system.

## How We Know

The proof is rock-solid:

**The Blood Test:** In April 2021, Dr. Osei ordered a test that measures an enzyme called TPP1. Eli's level was 0.8 — normal is between 5 and 25. This test result alone proves CLN2 disease. There's no other condition that causes this specific pattern.

**His Eyes:** Dr. Osei found orange-brown spots in the back of Eli's eyes. These are caused by the same waste products that damage his brain. You don't see these in autism — only in conditions like CLN2.

**The Brain Scans:** His April 2021 MRI showed his cerebellum (the brain part that controls movement) had shrunk by 35%. This specific pattern matches CLN2 disease perfectly.

**The Seizures:** His EEG in 2021 captured 11 seizures in 24 hours, including a very specific brain wave pattern that flashes when lights blink at certain speeds. This is a signature of CLN2.

**What You've Seen:** Everything you've been documenting for years — the loss of words, the walking getting worse, needing more and more equipment, the seizures — this is exactly how CLN2 progresses.

## What This Means

CLN2 disease explains everything you've been seeing:

- Why Eli learned to walk and talk, then slowly lost those skills
- Why he went from walking independently to needing AFOs, then a walker, then a wheelchair
- Why his seizures started and got worse over time  
- Why intensive autism therapy didn't help — because he doesn't have autism

The "autism" diagnosis he got at age 3 was wrong. What doctors saw as autism behaviors were actually the early signs of CLN2. This happens because CLN2 can look like autism in very young children, especially before the more obvious symptoms appear.

**This is NOT autism.** Autism doesn't make children lose skills they already learned. Autism doesn't cause the brain to shrink. Autism doesn't cause seizures or eye changes or the need for wheelchair and feeding tubes.

## What Happened — Why It Took So Long

**This is not your fault.** The medical system failed your family in multiple ways:

1. **The first failure:** The autism diagnosis at age 3 became a roadblock. Once that label was in place, doctors stopped looking for other explanations, even when Eli kept getting worse.

2. **The second failure:** Even when some people got it right, the system didn't listen. Look at your records — PT Sarah Lindgren wrote a letter in March 2020 specifically naming CLN2 as the most likely diagnosis. She was right. But no doctor followed up on her concerns.

3. **The biggest failure:** Dr. Osei solved the puzzle in April 2021. She had the diagnosis, the test results, everything. She was setting up treatment. But when you moved to North Carolina, the military medical records system lost everything. A confirmed diagnosis of a treatable condition just... disappeared.

You carried better medical records in your personal binder than what transferred through official channels.

The therapists saw it too. Your son's ABA therapist wrote that in 23 years and 190+ children with autism, she had never seen regression like Eli's. The physical therapists kept noting that something neurological was happening beyond just developmental delays. **They were right. You were right to listen to them.**

## What Comes Next

There are things we can do. CLN2 has treatments.

### Right Now — This Week

1. **Get Dr. Osei's records:** We need to get all of Eli's 2021 records from Nationwide Children's Hospital back into his current medical file. This includes the enzyme test, brain scans, and treatment plans.

2. **Treatment evaluation:** There's a medication called Brineura that can slow down CLN2 disease. Dr. Osei was arranging this in 2021. We need to find out what happened to that referral and get Eli evaluated now.

3. **Tell all his doctors:** Every doctor currently taking care of Eli needs to know about this diagnosis immediately.

### This Month

1. **Genetic testing:** Dr. Osei ordered DNA testing in 2021 to confirm the exact type of CLN2. We need to find those results or reorder the test.

2. **Eye doctor:** Get Eli's eyes examined by a specialist who understands CLN2 to see how we can best support his vision.

3. **Seizure management:** Work with neurology to optimize his seizure medications now that we know the real cause.

### Ongoing

1. **Family testing:** Both you and Eli's father carry the CLN2 gene (that's how genetics works with this condition). Testing can confirm this and provide information for any future family planning.

2. **Support team:** Connect with palliative care specialists who understand CLN2 and can help optimize Eli's quality of life and your family's support.

## Questions You Might Have

**"Could treatment have helped more if we'd known sooner?"**
Yes, and that's heartbreaking. The earlier Brineura treatment starts, the more brain function it can preserve. But even now at 14, some children still benefit. We won't know until we try.

**"Did the autism treatments hurt him?"**
No. The therapies weren't harmful, they just weren't treating the right condition. It's like giving someone cough medicine for pneumonia — not harmful, but not addressing the real problem.

**"Is this terminal?"**
CLN2 is a serious, progressive condition. But with treatment, some children live longer and maintain better quality of life than without treatment. Every situation is different.

**"Could we have other children with this condition?"**
There's a 25% chance with each pregnancy. But there are tests during pregnancy that can tell you for certain, and there are options.

**"How do I make sure this never happens again?"**
Document everything. Keep your binder system — it worked better than the official medical records. If you move again, personally hand-carry copies of all key records, especially the CLN2 diagnosis and treatment information.

**"Was I wrong to push so hard for answers?"**
**Absolutely not.** You were the only constant in Eli's care across all these moves and doctors. You saw the patterns. You kept the records. You never stopped advocating. Multiple professionals wrote in your records that you were an exceptional historian and advocate. Dr. Osei's diagnosis happened because you brought 9 years of detailed observations to her. You saved your son's diagnosis by keeping that binder when the medical system failed.

---

Mrs. Reeves, you have carried an incredible burden for 12 years. You have been dismissed, redirected, and told things that didn't match what you were seeing at home. But you never stopped fighting for answers.

You were right. The therapists who supported you were right. Dr. Osei was right. 

Now we move forward together, with the right diagnosis, toward the right treatments, with a clear understanding of what we're facing.

You don't have to carry this alone anymore.
