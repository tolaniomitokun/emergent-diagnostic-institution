      "evidence": "All three specialists maintain unanimous CLN2 convergence from Round 1 through Round 2, with confidence scores narrowing from 0.92/0.95/0.92 to 0.90/0.92/0.90. Per A-005 (amended), when Round 2 maintains unanimous convergence, the Observer must document the specific evidence driving each specialist's position and distinguish independent re-analysis from deference. Assessment: The convergence here is GENUINELY EVIDENCE-DRIVEN by the pathognomonic TPP1 enzyme result (0.8 nmol/hr/mg, <5% of normal), which all specialists correctly identify as qualitatively different from consensus driven by clinical interpretation. The framing independence exercises yielded DIFFERENT reasoning pathways: the neurologist prioritized cerebellar syndrome + EEG pattern, the developmental pediatrician prioritized the ABA regression trajectory + developmental timeline incompatibility with ASD, and the geneticist prioritized the clinical phenotype matching NCL presentation. These independent pathways converging on the same conclusion, anchored to an objective biochemical assay, represents genuine epistemic convergence rather than social influence. However, the narrow confidence range (0.90-0.92) remains somewhat suspicious for fully independent calibration.",
      "severity": "low",
      "recommendation": "No corrective action required. The convergence is defensible given the pathognomonic biochemical result. The framing independence exercises demonstrate genuine independent reasoning. Document this as an instance where unanimous convergence is APPROPRIATE given the strength of the anchoring evidence (enzymatic assay with >99% sensitivity/specificity)."

      "agent": "neurologist and geneticist",
      "evidence": "Per A-021 (Confidence Clustering Detection), the neurologist and geneticist both converged to exactly 0.90 \u2014 identical to two decimal places. In the prior case (user_case_1771089140822) and the SLE case (user_case_1771090182988), identical post-correction confidence values (0.82 in both instances) were flagged as potential anchoring to a perceived 'acceptable' post-correction value. Here, the neurologist reduced from 0.92 to 0.90 and the geneticist reduced from 0.92 to 0.90 \u2014 both adjusting downward by exactly 0.02 after Observer feedback. This symmetry warrants scrutiny. CALIBRATION RATIONALE COMPARISON: The neurologist states 0.90 reflects 'pending genetic confirmation and the Observer's valid concerns about unexamined alternatives.' The geneticist states 0.90 reflects 'the pending genetic confirmation and the identified atypical feature.' These rationales are substantively similar but arise from different analytical pathways \u2014 the neurologist emphasizes neurological alternatives while the geneticist emphasizes the walking-age discrepancy and assay reliability. This appears to be COINCIDENTAL CONVERGENCE rather than anchored convergence, as the 0.02 reduction maps to the single identified residual uncertainty (pending genetic sequencing).",
      "severity": "low",
      "recommendation": "Log as coincidental convergence. Both specialists provided distinct calibration rationales that independently justify the 0.02 reduction. The identical endpoint (0.90) appears to reflect a shared assessment of the single residual uncertainty (pending genetic confirmation) rather than mutual anchoring. No re-derivation required, but the synthesis phase should note that the effective confidence spread across all three specialists is only 0.02 (0.90-0.92), which provides minimal epistemic diversity for probability weighting."

      "bias_type": "confirmation",
      "agent": "developmental_pediatrician",
      "evidence": "The developmental pediatrician's confidence of 0.92 remains the highest of the three specialists, despite their Round 1 overconfidence being specifically flagged. Their decomposition (domain-specific 0.98, cross-domain 0.92 'aligned with geneticist's assessment') is improved but contains a subtle issue: they state cross-domain confidence is 'aligned with' the geneticist, but the geneticist's actual Round 2 confidence is 0.90, not 0.92. The developmental pediatrician appears to have anchored to the geneticist's ROUND 1 value (0.92) rather than their Round 2 value (0.90). This is a minor but documented calibration error suggesting the developmental pediatrician's confidence adjustment was performed relative to Round 1 positions rather than updated Round 2 positions.",
      "severity": "low",
      "recommendation": "The synthesis phase should use 0.90 as the cross-domain confidence anchor per the geneticist's Round 2 assessment, not the developmental pediatrician's 0.92. This is a minor discrepancy with no material impact on the diagnosis but documents a calibration lag."

      "bias_type": "framing",
      "agent": "all_specialists",
      "evidence": "All three specialists performed the mandated framing independence exercise (reconstructing their differential from Sections 1-2 alone, without the confirmed diagnosis). All three confirmed they would have prioritized NCL from the pre-diagnostic clinical data, which VALIDATES the convergence as not purely artifact of reading the confirmed diagnosis. However, a subtle residual framing effect persists: all three specialists performed this exercise AFTER reading the confirmed CLN2 diagnosis in Section 3 and then retrospectively evaluating whether they 'would have' reached NCL from earlier data. True framing independence would require evaluating Sections 1-2 WITHOUT having seen Section 3 \u2014 which is structurally impossible given the case presentation. The exercises are therefore hypothetical reconstructions that may be subject to hindsight bias ('I would have seen the NCL pattern'). The PT Sarah Lindgren DID reach NCL from the pre-diagnostic data in real time (March 2020 letter), providing external validation that the clinical pattern is recognizable, but the specialists' retrospective claims cannot be independently verified.",
      "severity": "low",
      "recommendation": "Accept the framing independence exercises as genuine good-faith efforts that improve upon Round 1's complete absence of such analysis. Note in the synthesis that the exercises are retrospective reconstructions subject to hindsight bias, and that the strongest validation comes from the real-time clinical reasoning of PT Sarah Lindgren, who correctly identified NCL as the leading differential from pre-diagnostic data."
