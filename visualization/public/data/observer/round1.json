      "evidence": "All three specialists converge on CLN2 disease as the primary diagnosis in Round 1 with confidence scores of 0.92, 0.95, and 0.92 respectively. Per Article 2.3, unanimous Round 1 agreement MUST trigger a consensus challenge and forced consideration of alternatives. The convergence is driven by the TPP1 enzyme result (0.8 nmol/hr/mg, pathognomonic), which IS a definitive biochemical test \u2014 making this convergence far more defensible than heuristic-driven agreement. However, no specialist formally considered: (a) the possibility the TPP1 result is a lab error or was drawn under conditions affecting accuracy, (b) whether a DUAL diagnosis (CLN2 + genuine comorbid ASD or a second contributing condition) could explain features disproportionate to CLN2 alone, or (c) whether any aspect of Eli's clinical picture is NOT explained by CLN2. The consensus, while likely correct, forecloses these questions prematurely.",
      "severity": "medium",
      "recommendation": "Article 2.3 mandatory challenge: In Round 2, at least one specialist must formally steelman an alternative scenario. Specifically: (1) the developmental pediatrician should evaluate whether the ADOS-2 findings at age 3.5 (comparison score 7, meeting autism cutoff) could represent genuine comorbid ASD independent of CLN2 manifestations, since this has management implications; (2) the neurologist should address whether the mitochondrial DNA VUS and elevated lactate/pyruvate warrant independent mitochondrial investigation even with confirmed CLN2, since secondary vs. primary mitochondrial dysfunction has treatment implications (CoQ10, carnitine supplementation); (3) the geneticist should address the probability that the TPP1 result could be erroneous and what confirmatory steps are required."

      "evidence": "The case narrative is structured as a 'diagnostic odyssey' that explicitly builds toward the CLN2 diagnosis \u2014 the Section 3 records contain the confirmed enzymatic result, the diagnosis discussion with the family, and Dr. Osei's unequivocal statement 'THIS CHILD'S CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS NOT AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER.' The case title itself ('14 Years of We Don't Know') frames this as a solved mystery. Per A-009 (External Source Framing Independence) and A-012 (Case Presentation Framing Independence), specialists should have flagged the case as containing a NARRATIVE FRAME and evaluated whether their conclusions would differ if the records had been presented as an unresolved case without the Section 3 diagnosis confirmation. No specialist flagged this framing. All three specialists essentially adopted the case's own diagnostic conclusion rather than independently deriving it from raw clinical data. The apparent 'independence' of three specialists all reaching CLN2 is partially an artifact of all three reading the same confirmed diagnosis in the records.",
      "severity": "low",
      "recommendation": "In Round 2, each specialist should explicitly state: (a) whether they would have reached CLN2 as their primary hypothesis from the Section 1-2 records ALONE (ages 0-7, before diagnosis), and (b) what their differential would have been at the point of presentation (age 14, mother brings records to new clinic) if Section 3 records were unavailable \u2014 as was the real-world scenario in North Carolina where the diagnosis was lost in records transfer. This exercise tests whether the institution can detect CLN2 from the pre-diagnostic clinical picture."

      "evidence": "Confidence of 0.95 exceeds the Article 1.4 threshold of 0.9 requiring Observer review. While the TPP1 enzyme result IS pathognomonic, the developmental pediatrician's stated confidence exceeds that of the geneticist (0.92) \u2014 the specialist whose domain expertise is most directly relevant to interpreting enzyme assay results. The developmental pediatrician's analysis is excellent but their confidence appears to reflect certainty about the clinical narrative (the retrospective case for diagnostic overshadowing) rather than a calibrated assessment of diagnostic probability. Per A-011 (Confidence Scope Binding), the 0.95 appears to bundle domain-specific confidence ('the developmental trajectory is incompatible with ASD': appropriately very high) with cross-domain confidence ('the TPP1 result confirms CLN2': should be deferred to or aligned with the geneticist's assessment). Additionally, genetic confirmation via CLN2/TPP1 gene sequencing remains pending per the available records.",
      "severity": "low",
      "recommendation": "Developmental pediatrician should decompose their confidence per A-011: domain-specific confidence (developmental trajectory analysis) and cross-domain confidence (biochemical/genetic confirmation). The developmental trajectory analysis may warrant 0.95, but the overall diagnostic confidence should not exceed the geneticist's 0.92 for the cross-domain genetic/enzymatic claim."

      "evidence": "All three specialists accepted the CLN2 diagnosis from Dr. Osei's records as established fact rather than treating it as a hypothesis to be independently verified (per A-006, Prior Diagnosis Skepticism Protocol). While the enzymatic evidence is compelling, the constitution's own A-006 mandates that 'prior diagnosis must be treated as a hypothesis to be tested, not a fact to be incorporated.' The CLN2 diagnosis from Ohio is a PRIOR DIAGNOSIS assigned by a previous provider \u2014 the same category as the ASD diagnosis that all three specialists correctly identified as problematic. The irony is noteworthy: the specialists rigorously questioned the ASD diagnosis (a prior label from age 3.5) while uncritically accepting the CLN2 diagnosis (a prior label from age 9). The difference in scrutiny appears driven by the specialists' agreement with the CLN2 diagnosis rather than by a consistent application of diagnostic skepticism.",
      "severity": "low",
      "recommendation": "In Round 2, apply A-006 symmetrically: the CLN2 diagnosis, like the ASD diagnosis, is a prior label assigned by a provider with access to a subset of currently available data. At least one specialist should formally evaluate whether the CLN2 enzymatic diagnosis is supported by the complete evidentiary record, including identifying any findings atypical for CLN2."
