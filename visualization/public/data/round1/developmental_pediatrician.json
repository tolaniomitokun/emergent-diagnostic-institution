  "diagnosis_hypothesis": "CLN2 disease (late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis / Batten disease) \u2014 enzymatically confirmed by TPP1 activity of 0.8 nmol/hr/mg (<5% of normal). The ASD diagnosis assigned at age 3.5 was a PARTIAL-DATA DIAGNOSIS that created catastrophic diagnostic overshadowing for approximately 6 years. The developmental trajectory is textbook CLN2, not autism.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "key_evidence": [
    "DISCRIMINATING: TPP1 enzyme activity 0.8 nmol/hr/mg (normal 5.0-25.0) \u2014 diagnostic for CLN2 disease, excludes ASD, mitochondrial disease, and other NCL subtypes as primary diagnosis",
    "DISCRIMINATING: Progressive LOSS of previously acquired motor skills \u2014 could button at age 4, could NOT button at age 6 (ABA records 05/2016 vs 11/2016). ASD does not cause loss of acquired fine motor skills. This is REGRESSION, the cardinal red flag for neurodegenerative disease.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: Progressive motor decline trajectory \u2014 independent walking (age 26 months) \u2192 AFOs (age 8) \u2192 posterior walker (age 8) \u2192 wheelchair (age 9.5) \u2192 non-ambulatory/Hoyer lift (age 9.5). GMFM-88 declined from 68% to 22% over 25 months of intensive PT. ASD is a STATIC condition; this trajectory is incompatible with ASD.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: Progressive speech regression \u2014 25 words at age 30 months \u2192 15-20 words at age 4 \u2192 5-8 words at age 6 \u2192 3-5 words at age 7 \u2192 <5 words at age 9. In regressive autism, language regression occurs at 15-24 months and then stabilizes or improves with intervention. Eli's regression was continuous, accelerating, and refractory to 672 hours of intensive ABA therapy.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: VB-MAPP scores declined 68.3% over 14 months of intensive ABA (31.5 \u2192 10.0). ABA therapists with combined 23 years experience and >190 ASD clients stated they had NEVER seen this pattern in a client whose primary diagnosis was ASD.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: Bilateral macular changes on fundoscopy (age 9, Dr. Osei) \u2014 orange-brown discoloration with surrounding retinal pallor, consistent with lipofuscin accumulation. This is a hallmark of NCL and is NEVER seen in ASD.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: EEG (age 9) showed photoparoxysmal response at 8-18 Hz \u2014 characteristic of NCL and progressive myoclonic epilepsies. Also showed 11 seizures in 24 hours (3 absence, 7 myoclonic, 1 GTC), ESES pattern, and severe background slowing (5-6 Hz, expected 9-10 Hz). ASD-associated seizures do not produce this specific EEG signature.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: MRI (age 9) showed SEVERE cerebellar atrophy with 35% volume loss (92 cm\u00b3 vs expected 135-145 cm\u00b3), disproportionate to cerebral atrophy with occipital-parietal predominance. ASD does not cause progressive cerebellar atrophy. The cerebellar predominance pattern is characteristic of CLN2.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: Emergence of upper motor neuron signs \u2014 DTRs progressed from 2+ (age 3-4) to 3+ (age 6) to 4+ with sustained clonus and bilateral positive Babinski (age 9). ASD does not cause corticospinal tract disease. This evolution from hypotonia to spasticity is classic for NCL.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: Rate-of-progression discordance (per A-019) \u2014 Eli went from independent ambulation to wheelchair dependence in approximately 24 months. ASD motor difficulties are static or slowly improving. The observed rate of motor decline is incompatible with any form of ASD and is diagnostic of a progressive neurodegenerative process.",
    "SHARED: Hand-wringing stereotypy \u2014 present in ASD (Criterion B1) AND in Rett syndrome AND in NCL. However, the ABA therapist noted it was 'qualitatively different from typical hand-flapping stereotypy commonly observed in our ASD population \u2014 more rhythmic and washing-like.' This quality is more consistent with NCL/Rett than ASD.",
    "SHARED: Limited social communication, limited eye contact, absent protodeclarative pointing \u2014 present in both ASD and early-stage NCL as the brain begins to degenerate. These features were the basis for the ASD diagnosis but are not DISCRIMINATING between ASD and NCL.",
    "SHARED: Elevated lactate 2.8 mmol/L (normal <2.0) \u2014 consistent with NCL and mitochondrial disease. The normal lactate/pyruvate ratio (23.3) and small lactate peak on MRS do not distinguish between these.",
    "CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTAL TIMELINE ANALYSIS: Normal milestones through 12 months (social smile 6 weeks, sitting 6 months, crawling 10.5 months, first words 12 months). Deceleration 12-24 months (walking achieved at 26 months, vocabulary plateau at ~20 words). Plateau 24-36 months (minimal gains despite therapy). Active regression from age 36 months onward (continuous, accelerating, multi-domain). This trajectory \u2014 normal development \u2192 deceleration \u2192 plateau \u2192 progressive regression \u2014 is the CLASSIC developmental signature of CLN2 disease with onset age 2-4 years.",
    "ASD DIAGNOSIS EVALUATION (per A-006 Prior Diagnosis Skepticism): The ASD diagnosis at age 3.5 was based on: (a) limited speech, (b) repetitive hand movements, (c) social withdrawal, (d) ADOS-2 score meeting autism cutoff. However, the evaluator (Dr. Whitfield) failed to: (1) order EEG despite staring spells witnessed during evaluation (2 episodes), (2) pursue metabolic workup despite motor delays atypical for ASD, (3) consider that all presenting features could represent EARLY MANIFESTATIONS of a neurodegenerative process rather than ASD. The MRI was read by a GENERAL radiologist, not a pediatric neuroradiologist. The evaluator explicitly stated 'EEG is not recommended at this time' \u2014 this was a critical error."

  "dissenting_considerations": [
    "COMORBID ASD: It is possible that Eli has genuine ASD as a comorbid condition alongside CLN2 disease. Dr. Osei appropriately listed ASD as 'possible comorbid' rather than removing it entirely. Some features at age 3 (limited joint attention, absent protodeclarative pointing, reduced social engagement) COULD represent true autism that was present before or concurrent with early NCL manifestations. However, retrospective differentiation is impossible \u2014 the early behavioral features of NCL and ASD overlap substantially at this age.",
    "MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE: Elevated lactate (2.8 mmol/L), elevated pyruvate, small lactate peak on MRS, and mitochondrial DNA variant of uncertain significance raise the possibility of a mitochondrial component. However, the TPP1 enzyme result is diagnostic for CLN2 as the primary condition. Secondary mitochondrial dysfunction can occur in lysosomal storage diseases.",
    "OTHER NCL SUBTYPES (CLN5, CLN6, CLN7, CLN8): While the clinical phenotype overlaps substantially with other late-infantile NCL variants, the specific TPP1 enzyme deficiency (<5% of normal) with all other lysosomal enzymes normal definitively identifies CLN2 over other NCL forms. Genetic confirmation (CLN2/TPP1 gene sequencing) is pending but the enzyme result alone is diagnostic.",
    "RETT SYNDROME: The hand-wringing stereotypy, regression, seizures, and loss of purposeful hand function overlap significantly with Rett syndrome. However, Rett is almost exclusively X-linked dominant in females (though rare male cases exist). The macular changes, cerebellar atrophy pattern, and TPP1 deficiency conclusively exclude Rett as the primary diagnosis.",
    "TIMING OF TREATMENT IMPACT: CLN2 has FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy (cerliponase alfa/Brineura, approved April 2017). Had the ASD diagnosis been questioned at age 4-5 when regression became evident, and appropriate workup performed (EEG, metabolic labs, genetic testing), Eli could potentially have been diagnosed by age 5-6 and started on cerliponase alfa while still walking independently, still speaking in sentences, and with substantially more preserved neurological function. The estimated 5-6 year diagnostic delay represents a significant loss of therapeutic window for a TREATABLE condition (per A-004 TREATABLE-URGENT)."
