  "diagnosis_hypothesis": "CLN2 Disease (Late-Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis / Batten Disease) \u2014 ALREADY BIOCHEMICALLY CONFIRMED in existing records (TPP1 enzyme activity 0.8 nmol/hr/mg, critically deficient at <5% of normal). This diagnosis was established by Dr. Amara Osei at Nationwide Children's Hospital in April 2021 (age 9) but was LOST during military records transfer. The elevated lactate (2.8 mmol/L) and mitochondrial DNA VUS are secondary findings \u2014 the primary lysosomal storage disease causes secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. TREATABLE-URGENT: Cerliponase alfa (Brineura), FDA-approved ERT for CLN2, exists but efficacy diminishes with disease progression. Every month of continued diagnostic uncertainty represents lost therapeutic opportunity.",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "key_evidence": [
    "DISCRIMINATING: TPP1 enzyme activity 0.8 nmol/hr/mg (normal 5.0-25.0, <5% of normal) \u2014 collected 04/07/2021, result 04/21/2021 \u2014 this is DIAGNOSTIC for CLN2 disease and is present in the Section 3 records from Nationwide Children's Hospital (Record 8.4). No other condition produces isolated TPP1 deficiency with normal PPT1 and normal other lysosomal enzymes.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: Bilateral macular changes \u2014 orange-brown discoloration with surrounding retinal pallor documented by Dr. Osei on fundoscopic exam (03/08/2021, Record 8.1) \u2014 consistent with lipofuscin accumulation in retinal neurons, a hallmark of NCL and NOT seen in mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, or primary epilepsy syndromes.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: Photoparoxysmal response on 24-hour video EEG (04/05-06/2021, Record 8.2) \u2014 robust response at 8-18 Hz flash frequencies with generalized spike-and-wave discharge and myoclonic jerk \u2014 this is CHARACTERISTIC of NCL and progressive myoclonic epilepsies, not typical of mitochondrial disease or ASD-associated epilepsy.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: All other lysosomal enzymes NORMAL (PPT1 14.2, Beta-Galactosidase 42, Hex A 18.4, Hex B 22.1, Arylsulfatase A 8.7, Beta-Glucosidase 11.3) \u2014 excludes CLN1, GM1/GM2 gangliosidosis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Gaucher disease, and other lysosomal storage diseases. The ISOLATED TPP1 deficiency is specific to CLN2.",
    "DISCRIMINATING: MRI pattern \u2014 DISPROPORTIONATE cerebellar atrophy (35% volume loss, cerebellar volume 92 cm\u00b3 vs expected 135-145 cm\u00b3) with occipital-predominant cortical atrophy and thalamic pulvinar signal changes (Record 8.3, 04/07/2021) \u2014 this specific MRI pattern is characteristic of CLN2 and distinguishes it from mitochondrial disease (which typically shows basal ganglia/brainstem predominance) and CLN3 (which shows more diffuse cortical pattern).",
    "SHARED: Elevated lactate 2.8 mmol/L (normal <2.0) with elevated pyruvate 0.12 mmol/L and NORMAL L/P ratio 23.3 (<25) \u2014 consistent with CLN2 (secondary mitochondrial dysfunction from lysosomal storage is well-documented) but also consistent with primary mitochondrial disease. The NORMAL L/P ratio argues against primary respiratory chain deficiency. Small lactate peak on MR spectroscopy of basal ganglia corroborates secondary mitochondrial involvement.",
    "SHARED: Progressive cerebellar ataxia, multiple seizure types (11 seizures in 24 hours \u2014 3 absence, 7 myoclonic, 1 GTC), cognitive regression, speech regression from sentences to <5 words, dysphagia requiring G-tube, progressive spasticity with Babinski positive bilaterally \u2014 consistent with CLN2 but also seen in mitochondrial encephalopathy, other NCL subtypes, and progressive myoclonic epilepsies.",
    "SHARED: Stereotypic hand-wringing movements (first noted age 20 months, progressive) \u2014 initially attributed to ASD but equally consistent with NCL, Rett-like syndromes, and other neurodegenerative conditions. These are NOT discriminating for any single diagnosis.",
    "SHARED: Developmental trajectory \u2014 normal through 12 months, vocabulary plateau at 20 words by age 2, walking at 26 months (delayed), progressive regression beginning age 3-4 \u2014 consistent with late-infantile onset NCL (classic CLN2 onset 2-4 years) but also consistent with late-infantile mitochondrial disease onset.",
    "CRITICAL RECORDS FINDING: The CLN2 diagnosis was CONFIRMED at age 9 by Dr. Osei (Record 8.5, 06/14/2021) but records from Nationwide Children's Hospital were NOT transferred to North Carolina providers. Dr. Washington's records (Section 4) document multiple failed attempts to obtain Dr. Osei's records. The partially legible fax (Dr. Park's note, 09/12/2023) references 'CLN or mitochondrial' but the TPP1 result was never successfully transmitted. The mother's personal binder contains the ONLY complete documentation."

  "dissenting_considerations": [
    "Mitochondrial disease (MERRF, mitochondrial complex deficiencies): The elevated lactate (2.8 mmol/L), elevated pyruvate, mitochondrial DNA variant of uncertain significance, lactate peak on MRS, and clinical features of progressive ataxia/myoclonus/seizures/regression overlap significantly with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. However, the NORMAL L/P ratio (23.3) is atypical for primary respiratory chain deficiency, the ISOLATED TPP1 deficiency is not explained by mitochondrial disease, the macular changes are not typical of MERRF/MELAS, and the photoparoxysmal EEG response is more characteristic of NCL. The mtDNA VUS is likely incidental (VUS by definition) or may reflect secondary mitochondrial dysfunction from lysosomal storage. Probability: 0.03.",
    "CLN5 or CLN6 variant late-infantile NCL: These subtypes can present with nearly identical clinical phenotype to CLN2 (onset 4-7 years, seizures, ataxia, cognitive decline, visual loss). However, CLN5/CLN6 would NOT cause TPP1 enzyme deficiency \u2014 the isolated low TPP1 is specific to CLN2 (TPP1 gene mutations). If the enzyme result were unavailable or questioned, CLN5/CLN6 would be strong differential candidates. Genetic confirmation via CLN2/TPP1 gene sequencing (which was sent per Record 8.5 but results not yet in available records) would definitively resolve this. Probability: 0.02.",
    "Rett syndrome or CDKL5-related disorder (partially outside primary genetics domain into neurodevelopmental): The hand-wringing stereotypies, regression after initial normal development, seizures, and loss of purposeful hand use are features shared with Rett-like syndromes. However: (a) classic Rett (MECP2) is overwhelmingly female; while male MECP2 mutations exist, they typically cause severe neonatal encephalopathy; (b) the PROGRESSIVE cerebellar atrophy with 35% volume loss is NOT a feature of Rett syndrome; (c) the macular changes and photoparoxysmal response are NOT seen in Rett; (d) the TPP1 deficiency is not explained by Rett. The hand-wringing in this case is best understood as a manifestation of the neurodegenerative process rather than ASD/Rett. Probability: 0.01.",
    "Autoimmune cerebellar degeneration / autoimmune encephalitis (outside genetics domain): Progressive cerebellar ataxia with seizures could represent autoimmune cerebellitis. However, this was appropriately excluded by Dr. Osei's workup: ESR 8 (normal), CRP 0.3 (normal), ANA negative, anti-GAD65 negative (Record 8.4). The 6+ year progressive course is also atypical for autoimmune cerebellitis, which tends to be subacute. Probability: <0.01.",
    "CRITICAL CONSIDERATION \u2014 Autosomal recessive inheritance implications: CLN2 is autosomal recessive (TPP1 gene, chromosome 11p15.4). Both parents are OBLIGATE CARRIERS. Carrier frequency ~1:200-500 in the general population. The non-consanguineous, mixed-race parentage does not reduce risk \u2014 NCL occurs across all ethnicities. If the family has future children, there is a 25% recurrence risk. Parental carrier testing and genetic counseling were recommended by Dr. Osei (Record 8.5) \u2014 status of completion unknown from available records. The paternal grandmother's 'memory problems' (onset late 50s, progressive) are likely coincidental but should be noted; adult NCL (CLN4/Kufs disease) is exceedingly rare and typically autosomal dominant \u2014 extremely unlikely to be related.",
    "TREATABLE-URGENT FLAG: CLN2 disease has an FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy \u2014 cerliponase alfa (Brineura), approved April 2017, administered intracerebroventricularly every 2 weeks. Clinical trials demonstrate slowing of motor and language decline when started EARLY. Dr. Osei noted this treatment at the June 2021 diagnosis discussion (Record 8.5) and referred to a CLN2 treatment center. The status of this referral is unknown from the truncated records. If the NC providers are unaware of the confirmed CLN2 diagnosis, they may not have pursued this treatment. IMMEDIATE ACTION: Confirm the CLN2 diagnosis is communicated to current providers. Evaluate for Brineura eligibility despite advanced disease stage \u2014 some benefit may still be achievable."
