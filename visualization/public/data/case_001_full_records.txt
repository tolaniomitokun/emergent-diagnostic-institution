OFFICE VISIT — 12-MONTH WELL-CHILD CHECK
Date of Service: March 18, 2013
Patient Age: 12 months 3 days
ICD-10: Z00.129
CPT: 99392, 90460, 90461

SUBJECTIVE:
Mother brings Eli for his 12-month well-child check. She reports he is pulling
to stand and has been doing so for approximately 2 weeks. He is not yet
cruising along furniture. He crawled (on hands and knees) starting at
approximately 10.5 months. He says 3-4 words: "mama," "dada," "no," and
something that sounds like "ba" for ball. He points to objects he wants
(usually food or a toy) with his index finger. He claps his hands, plays
pat-a-cake. He is eating a variety of table foods. He drinks from a sippy cup.
Mother has recently weaned from breastfeeding. She plans to start whole milk.

Mother states: "He seems a little behind the other kids in our playgroup —
they're all walking by now. Is that normal?" She mentions that a friend's baby
the same age is running already. Father is present at this visit and does not
express concern: "My brother didn't walk until 15 months and he's fine."

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:
  Weight: 21 lbs 0 oz (9.53 kg) — 40th percentile
  Length: 29.5 inches (74.9 cm) — 38th percentile
  Head Circumference: 46.0 cm — 40th percentile
  Temperature: 98.6 F (37.0 C)
  Heart Rate: 118 bpm
  Respiratory Rate: 26 breaths/min

General: Active, alert toddler. Crawling on exam room floor. Pulling to stand
on mother's leg during visit.

Physical Exam: Within normal limits. HEENT: 8 teeth. Ears: bilateral TMs clear
with normal landmarks and mobility. Heart: RRR, no murmur. Lungs: CTA
bilaterally. Abdomen: soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly.

Neurological/Developmental:
  Denver Developmental Screening Test II (DDST-II) administered:
    Personal-Social: NORMAL — drinks from cup, plays ball, indicates wants.
    Fine Motor-Adaptive: NORMAL — pincer grasp (refined), scribbles with
      crayon (with demonstration), puts block in cup.
    Language: NORMAL — 3-4 specific words, understands simple commands
      ("give me the ball"), points to objects.
    Gross Motor: MARGINAL — pulling to stand but NOT cruising. Not walking.
      Expected milestone for 12 months includes pulling to stand and
      beginning to cruise. Cruising typically emerges by 9-12 months. This
      places Eli at the low end of the expected range for gross motor.

  Additional observations:
  - Eye contact: Good. Engages with examiner.
  - Social referencing: Looks to mother when uncertain — present.
  - Joint attention: Points to items and looks back to mother — present.
  - Responds to name: Yes.
  - No repetitive behaviors observed during visit.
  - Tone: Appears normal on examination. Strength symmetric.
  - Reflexes: 2+ throughout, symmetric. Plantar response — flexor
    bilaterally (normal for age).

ASSESSMENT:
1. 12-month-old male. Growth tracking at 38th-40th percentile — slight
   downward trend from earlier percentiles (was ~48th at 2 months), still
   within normal range.
2. Developmental milestones: Language, fine motor, social/emotional — all
   age-appropriate. Gross motor mildly delayed — pulling to stand but not
   cruising. Denver screen marginal in gross motor domain.
3. Not walking is NOT abnormal at 12 months. Normal range for independent
   walking is 9-18 months. However, the lack of cruising at 12 months bears
   monitoring.

PLAN:
1. Immunizations: MMR #1, Varicella #1, HepA #1, PCV13 #4. Administered.
2. Transition to whole milk. Limit to 16-24 oz/day.
3. Discussed gross motor findings with parents. Reassured that gross motor
   development is at the low end of normal and many children, particularly
   boys, walk later. However, if not cruising by 15 months or walking by 18
   months, will refer for evaluation.
4. Encouraged active play, push toys, assisted standing activities.
5. Lead screen ordered — result pending.
6. Hemoglobin checked — 11.8 g/dL (normal).
7. Next visit: 15-month well-child check.

Patient Age: 15 months 4 days
ICD-10: Z00.129
CPT: 99392, 90460

SUBJECTIVE:
Mother reports Eli is now cruising along furniture — started about 3 weeks ago.
He is not walking independently. He will stand unsupported for a few seconds
before sitting down. His vocabulary has grown to approximately 8 words: "mama,"
"dada," "no," "ball," "ba" (for bottle), "dog," "up," and "bye-bye." He
understands many words and can follow simple one-step commands. He is feeding
himself with fingers and attempting to use a spoon. Sleeping well. No illnesses.

Mother again expresses mild concern: "My friend's kids his age are all walking
and running. He's still just cruising." Father is not present — currently on a
2-week training rotation.

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:
  Weight: 22 lbs 8 oz (10.21 kg) — 38th percentile
  Length: 30.5 inches (77.5 cm) — 36th percentile
  Head Circumference: 46.8 cm — 38th percentile
  Temperature: 98.2 F (36.8 C)
  Heart Rate: 112 bpm
  Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths/min

General: Alert, active toddler. Cruising along exam table. Babbling and using
words during visit.

Physical Exam: Unremarkable. No new findings.

Neurological/Developmental:
  - Gross motor: Cruising along furniture. Stands independently for 3-5
    seconds. Not walking. Wide base of support when standing.
  - Fine motor: Stacks 2 blocks. Turns pages of board book (several at a
    time). Drinks from sippy cup. Attempting spoon use.
  - Language: ~8 words, used appropriately in context. Points and
    vocalizes to request. Follows one-step commands ("bring me the ball").
  - Social: Imitates household activities (pretends to talk on phone).
    Interactive, makes eye contact.

Note: M-CHAT-R/F is validated for 16-30 months. Will administer at 18-month
visit. Too early for reliable screening at this visit.

ASSESSMENT:
1. 15-month-old male. Growth continuing along 36th-38th percentile range.
   Percentiles have drifted downward modestly from newborn period but remain
   within normal limits.
2. Gross motor: Cruising at 15 months. Still not walking independently. While
   delayed relative to mean (walking typically achieved by 12-13 months),
   independent walking up to 18 months is within normal variation. Boys
   frequently walk later than girls.
3. Language: On track with 8 words at 15 months (expected: at least 3-5 words).
4. Fine motor and social/emotional: Age-appropriate.

PLAN:
1. Immunizations: DTaP #4 administered.
2. Reassured mother that cruising at 15 months, while on the later side, is
   within normal developmental variation. Explained that many children,
   especially boys, walk between 15-18 months. "Boys develop at their own
   pace — and Eli is making steady progress with cruising."
3. If NOT walking independently by 18 months, will pursue formal gross motor
   evaluation.
4. Encouraged continued active play, push toys, walking with one hand held.
5. Next visit: 18-month well-child check. Will administer M-CHAT-R/F at that
   time.

OFFICE VISIT — 18-MONTH WELL-CHILD CHECK
Date of Service: September 18, 2013
Patient Age: 18 months 3 days
ICD-10: Z00.129, R62.0 (Delayed milestone in childhood)
CPT: 99392, 96110 (Developmental screening)

SUBJECTIVE:
Mother brings Eli in with increasing concern. He is STILL NOT walking
independently. He continues to cruise along furniture and will walk holding
one of a parent's hands but will not take independent steps. He has been
cruising for approximately 3 months without progression. Mother reports his
vocabulary has expanded to approximately 12 words but notes: "It seems like
he's slowed down with learning new words. He was picking up words faster a
couple months ago." Current words per mother's list: mama, dada, no, ball,
bottle, dog, up, bye-bye, more, juice, car, shoe. No two-word combinations.

Mother also notes: "He doesn't point at things in books when I ask him to —
like, 'Where's the dog?' He just stares at the page." She also reports that
when she points at something across the room, he doesn't consistently follow
her point — "sometimes he does, sometimes he just looks at my hand."

Father present by phone (FaceTime) — asks if this is related to his mother's
memory issues. "Could something run in the family?" Dr. Mitchell notes this
question in chart.

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:
  Weight: 23 lbs 4 oz (10.55 kg) — 36th percentile
  Length: 31.5 inches (80.0 cm) — 33rd percentile
  Head Circumference: 47.5 cm — 37th percentile
  Temperature: 98.4 F (36.9 C)
  Heart Rate: 110 bpm
  Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths/min

General: Alert toddler. Cruising along furniture in exam room. Held mother's
hand to walk to exam table. Babbling with intermittent recognizable words.

Physical Exam: Unremarkable. No dysmorphic features. Ears clear.

Neurological/Developmental:
  - Gross motor: NOT walking independently. Cruises well. Walks with one
    hand held. Wide base of support. Sits independently without issue.
    Can get to standing from sitting by pulling up on furniture.
  - Fine motor: Stacks 3 blocks. Scribbles. Turns pages.
  - Language (expressive): ~12 words. No word combinations. Uses words
    inconsistently — sometimes uses "more" and "juice" at mealtimes, other
    times does not use words when context is appropriate.
  - Language (receptive): Follows some one-step commands (e.g., "give me
    the cup") but inconsistent. Does NOT point to body parts on request.
    Does NOT point to pictures in books on request.
  - Social: Eye contact present but somewhat inconsistent during visit.
    Does not consistently follow examiner's or mother's point.

M-CHAT-R/F Screening (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised
with Follow-Up):
  Administered via parent questionnaire.
  Total Score: 4/20 (2 critical items failed)
  Failed items:
    - Item 7: "Does your child point with one finger to ask for something
      or to get help?" — Parent answered YES but with qualifier: "sometimes,
      but not always." On follow-up questioning, pointing is inconsistent
      and emerging. Scored as PASS per follow-up clarification.
    - Item 13: "Does your child point with one finger to show you something
      interesting?" — FAIL. Mother confirms Eli does not point to share
      interest (protodeclarative pointing absent).
    - Item 15: "If you point at something across the room, does your child
      look at it?" — FAIL. Mother confirms he does not consistently follow
      a point.
    - Item 2: "Have you ever wondered if your child might be deaf?" — Parent
      marked YES. Follow-up: "Not really deaf, but sometimes he doesn't
      respond when I call him." Scored as at-risk response.
    - Item 6: "Does your child reach up to be picked up?" — FAIL on initial
      screen; PASS on follow-up (he does reach but inconsistently).

  Interpretation: Score of 4 with 2 critical item failures places Eli in the
  BORDERLINE/LOW-RISK positive range. Per M-CHAT-R/F algorithm, 2 critical
  item failures = warrants monitoring. Score of 3-7 = administer follow-up
  interview. Follow-up interview completed; final score: 2 critical items
  still failed after follow-up.

ASSESSMENT:
1. 18-month-old male with gross motor delay — not walking independently at
   18 months. This now exceeds typical variation and warrants evaluation.
2. Language development showing plateau — 12 words but inconsistent use. No
   word combinations. Receptive language lagging (not following points
   consistently, not identifying body parts).
3. M-CHAT-R/F: Borderline. Two critical items failed (protodeclarative
   pointing absent, not following point). Does not meet high-risk threshold
   but concerning in context of other delays.
4. Growth: Slight continued decline in percentiles — now 33rd-36th. Still
   within normal limits but trend noted.

PLAN:
1. Immunizations: DTaP #4 (was given at 15 months — confirmed in record).
   HepA #2 administered today.
2. Referral to Virginia Infant & Toddler Connection (Part C Early
   Intervention) for comprehensive developmental evaluation. Requesting PT
   and speech-language evaluations specifically.
   Contact information provided to mother: Richmond area Early Intervention
   coordinator, (804) 555-0291.
3. Gross motor delay: Formal physical therapy evaluation requested.
4. Language concerns: Formal speech-language evaluation requested.
5. Discussed concerns with mother at length. Reassured parents that
   developmental variation is common, especially in boys, and that early
   intervention services are supportive and commonly used. "Many children
   with mild delays catch up with a little help."
6. Regarding father's question about family history of memory problems:
   Explained that his mother's memory issues are more likely age-related
   and that there is no clear connection to Eli's developmental pattern at
   this time. Will keep in mind.
7. Hearing: Normal hearing screen at 6 months. Consider repeat if language
   does not progress.
8. Next well-child visit at 24 months. Return sooner if concerns escalate.

OFFICE VISIT — 24-MONTH WELL-CHILD CHECK
Date of Service: March 19, 2014
Patient Age: 24 months 4 days
ICD-10: Z00.129, F80.2 (Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder),
R62.0 (Delayed milestone), R29.3 (Abnormal posture — toe-walking)
CPT: 99392, 96110

SUBJECTIVE:
Mother brings Eli for his 2-year well-child check. She reports significant
milestones and concerns.

Walking: Eli began walking independently approximately 2 weeks ago (at 23.5
months / nearly 24 months, though mother states closer to 26 months by her
own count, correcting a mental math error — "he turned 2 two weeks ago and
he's been walking for about a month, so it was 23 months... no wait, he's
24 months now and started walking maybe 6-8 weeks ago — so about 22-23 months."
Clarified in note as approximately 22-23 months based on maternal report).

[ADDENDUM 04/01/2014: Mother called to clarify walking timeline. States she
reviewed her own records and Eli took first independent steps at approximately
25 months and was consistently walking by 26 months. Previous estimate of 22-23
months was incorrect. Chart updated accordingly. — S. Mitchell, MD]

Vocabulary: Approximately 20 words. Mother has kept a written list: mama, dada,
no, ball, bottle, dog, up, bye-bye, more, juice, car, shoe, eat, milk, book,
baby, hi, mine, hot, and cookie. NO two-word combinations. Mother states:
"He hasn't really learned new words in the last couple months. It's like he's
stuck at 20." No pronoun use. No phrases. Does not put words together.

New concern — toe-walking: Mother reports that since Eli started walking, he
frequently walks on his toes. "He walks normally some of the time, but a lot
of the time he's up on his toes. I've asked the daycare and they see it too."
Estimated toe-walking approximately 40-50% of the time per parent report.

New concern — hand movements: Mother describes: "He does this thing with his
hands — he wrings them together, like he's washing them. He does it a lot when
he's sitting and watching TV or when he's not playing with something. It's
gotten more frequent." She estimates this occurs 5-8 times per day, lasting
20-30 seconds each episode. She first noticed it around 20 months but it has
become more prominent.

Staring spells: Mother mentions for the first time: "Sometimes he just zones
out. He'll be sitting there and it's like he's not there for a few seconds.
Then he snaps out of it and keeps going. It happens maybe a couple times a
week." Duration estimated at 5-10 seconds. No associated movements per mother's
report. No eye rolling, no lip smacking, no incontinence. She has not been
able to interrupt the episodes by calling his name. "It's like he can't hear
me during those moments."

Early intervention services: PT started at 20 months, speech therapy started
at 20 months. Mother reports mixed progress (see therapy reports below).

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:
  Weight: 25 lbs 4 oz (11.45 kg) — 35th percentile
  Length: 33.0 inches (83.8 cm) — 30th percentile
  Head Circumference: 48.2 cm — 35th percentile
  Temperature: 98.6 F (37.0 C)
  Heart Rate: 105 bpm
  Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/min

General: Active toddler. Walking independently in exam room. Observed toe-
walking intermittently — approximately 3 out of 10 steps on toes during
initial observation in hallway.

Physical Exam: HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Eyes: PERRL, no strabismus.
Ears: TMs clear bilaterally. Oropharynx clear. Heart: RRR, no murmur. Lungs:
CTA bilaterally. Abdomen: soft, non-tender, no organomegaly. Skin: Clear.

Neurological/Developmental:
  - Gait: Walking independently. Wide-based gait. Intermittent bilateral
    toe-walking. When walking flat-footed, gait appears mildly uncoordinated
    with occasional loss of balance requiring 1-2 compensatory steps.
  - Tone: Examined carefully. Appears within normal limits — no obvious
    spasticity, no rigidity, no frank hypotonia. Ankle dorsiflexion to
    neutral with knee extended bilaterally (no Achilles contracture).
  - Reflexes: 2+ throughout. Plantar response: flexor bilaterally.
  - Hand-wringing: OBSERVED during visit on 2 occasions. Child seated in
    mother's lap, hands brought to midline, repetitive wringing/washing
    motion lasting approximately 15-20 seconds each episode. Did not appear
    distressed during episodes. Resumed reaching for toy afterward.
  - Staring episode: One possible episode observed. Child was seated and
    appeared to briefly disengage — stared fixedly for approximately 6-7
    seconds. Did not respond to name during episode. Then appeared to
    "return" and reached for toy. No associated motor phenomena noted. No
    eye deviation, no lip movements, no body stiffening.
  - Fine motor: Stacks 4 blocks. Scribbles with crayon (circular). Turns
    pages of book one at a time.
  - Language: Used "mama," "more," and "ball" during visit. No spontaneous
    phrases or combinations.
  - Social: Eye contact intermittent — present when engaged one-on-one but
    not sustained during free play. Responded to name approximately 3/5
    attempts. Did not point to share interest during visit. Did show a toy
    to mother (held it up toward her).

M-CHAT-R/F Screening:
  Administered per 24-month protocol.
  Total Score: 6/20 (3 critical items failed)
  Critical items failed:
    - Item 13 (protodeclarative pointing): FAIL
    - Item 15 (following point): FAIL — inconsistent
    - Item 5 (unusual finger movements near face): FAIL — hand-wringing
      noted, though this item is technically about finger movements near
      the face. Parent described hand movements at midline. Counted as
      at-risk response based on clinical judgment given repetitive nature.
  Additional at-risk responses on items 2, 7, and 9.

  Interpretation: Total score of 6 with 3 critical items failed = POSITIVE
  SCREEN. Per M-CHAT-R/F algorithm: score >= 3 with >= 2 critical failures
  after follow-up = REFER for diagnostic evaluation.

ASSESSMENT:
1. 24-month-old male with multiple developmental concerns:
   a. Gross motor delay — walking achieved at approximately 26 months
      (significantly delayed; normal range up to 18 months).
   b. Intermittent bilateral toe-walking.
   c. Mixed receptive-expressive language delay — 20 words, no combinations,
      at 24 months (expected: 50+ words with 2-word phrases).
   d. Repetitive hand-wringing movements — new concern, etiology unclear.
      Differential includes stereotypic movement disorder vs. self-
      stimulatory behavior vs. other.
   e. Staring spells — brief episodes of apparent disengagement. Duration
      5-10 seconds. Unclear etiology. Differential includes normal childhood
      inattention/focused play vs. absence seizures vs. dissociative episodes.
      Given age and brief duration, most likely represent focused play or
      benign staring spells, but will continue to monitor.
   f. M-CHAT positive — warrants formal developmental/autism evaluation.
2. Growth: Percentiles continue gradual decline (now 30th-35th from 50th at
   birth). Trajectory concerning for deceleration vs. simply finding his curve.
   Nutritional intake appears adequate per parental report.
3. Early intervention services in progress.

PLAN:
1. Referral placed to developmental pediatrics — Children's Developmental
   Center of Virginia, Dr. James Whitfield. Appointment requested urgently
   given M-CHAT positive screen and multiple areas of concern. Family
   advised wait time is approximately 4-6 months.
2. Continue early intervention services (PT and speech therapy).
3. Staring spells: Given brief duration, absence of motor phenomena, and
   age of patient — monitoring at this time. Instructed mother to keep a
   diary of episodes including frequency, duration, context, and any
   associated symptoms. Will revisit at next visit and discuss with
   developmental pediatrician.
4. Toe-walking: Discussed with PT. Will incorporate targeted stretching and
   gait training into PT sessions.
5. Ordered: CBC, CMP, TSH/Free T4, lead level — screening labs for
   developmental delay. Results to follow.
6. Mother very anxious. Spent extended time counseling (total visit time
   45 minutes). Discussed early intervention benefits. "We are going to take
   this one step at a time, and the developmental pediatrician will be our
   best resource for a thorough assessment."
7. Next well-child visit at 30 months or sooner if concerns escalate.

Lab results received March 22, 2014:
  CBC: WNL (Hgb 12.1, Hct 36.2, WBC 8.4, Plt 285)
  CMP: WNL (all values within normal reference ranges)
  TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (normal: 0.5-4.5)
  Free T4: 1.2 ng/dL (normal: 0.8-1.8)
  Lead: <2 mcg/dL (normal)

OFFICE VISIT — 30-MONTH WELL-CHILD CHECK
Date of Service: September 17, 2014
Patient Age: 30 months 2 days
ICD-10: Z00.129, F80.2, R62.0, R29.3, F98.4 (Stereotypic movement disorder)
CPT: 99392

SUBJECTIVE:
Mother brings Eli for 30-month well-child visit. Developmental pediatrics
appointment is scheduled for 2 weeks from now (October 1, 2014 — wait was
approximately 6 months from referral).

Speech therapy progress: Mother reviewed most recent ST progress report with
this provider. Per report, Eli's vocabulary has expanded to approximately 25
words but spontaneous use in context remains limited. He is using some words
in structured therapy sessions but not generalizing well to home environment.
He has attempted 1-2 two-word combinations in therapy ("more juice," "want
ball") but these are inconsistent and require prompting. Receptive language
shows some gains — he is following some one-step commands more consistently
and beginning to identify body parts (nose, eyes) with about 50% accuracy.

Physical therapy progress: PT report states: "Eli is walking independently
with a wide-based gait and intermittent bilateral toe-walking. Toe-walking
appears to occur approximately 30-40% of the time, unchanged from last
assessment. Balance reactions are delayed relative to age — he has difficulty
recovering from mild perturbations and falls 2-3 times during a 30-minute
session. He is not yet running consistently. He can climb stairs with hand-
held assistance. He cannot jump."

Mother reports staring spells are now occurring more frequently — "maybe once
a day, sometimes more." Duration still 5-10 seconds. She has been keeping a
diary as instructed: over the past month, she documented approximately 25-30
episodes. Most last 5-8 seconds. They occur at various times — during play,
during meals, during TV time. During episodes, he stops all activity, stares
straight ahead, and does not respond to name or touch. After the episode, he
resumes what he was doing without apparent confusion or distress. No motor
phenomena observed by mother. No incontinence. No preceding aura behaviors
that mother can identify.

Hand-wringing: Persists. Mother estimates 8-10 episodes daily.

Mother states: "I'm really worried. He's not getting better fast enough. The
other kids at daycare are talking in sentences. He can barely say 20 words."

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:
  Weight: 27 lbs 0 oz (12.25 kg) — 33rd percentile
  Length: 34.5 inches (87.6 cm) — 28th percentile
  Head Circumference: 48.8 cm — 33rd percentile
  Temperature: 98.4 F (36.9 C)
  Heart Rate: 102 bpm
  Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/min

General: Alert toddler. Walking in exam room with wide-based gait. Toe-walking
observed (3/10 steps approximately). Hand-wringing observed once during visit
(approximately 15 seconds duration, child seated in mother's lap, hands at
midline).

Physical Exam: Unchanged from prior. No new findings. Heart, lungs, abdomen
within normal limits. No hepatosplenomegaly. No skin findings.

Neurological/Developmental:
  - Gait: Wide-based, intermittent toe-walking. No definite ataxia but
    mildly uncoordinated. Falls to seated position once during visit when
    turning.
  - Tone: Examined again carefully. Bilateral lower extremities — appears
    mildly reduced tone on passive range of motion, though difficult to
    ascertain as child is not fully cooperative with exam. Upper extremity
    tone appears normal. [Note: This is the first suggestion of possible
    hypotonia in the record, though not definitively stated.]
  - Reflexes: 2+ throughout. Plantar response flexor bilaterally.
  - No staring episode observed during this visit (30-minute encounter).
  - Language: Said "mama," "no," and "more" during visit. No combinations
    observed.
  - Social: Intermittent eye contact. Brief shared attention when mother
    showed him a book. Did not point during visit.

ASSESSMENT:
1. 30-month-old male with persistent global developmental delays affecting
   gross motor, fine motor, and language domains. Multiple stereotypic
   behaviors (hand-wringing) present.
2. Staring spells — increasing in frequency per parent diary (~1/day). Remain
   brief (5-10 seconds) and non-convulsive. Etiology unclear. Will raise with
   developmental pediatrics at upcoming evaluation.
3. Developmental pediatrics referral active — appointment in 2 weeks.
4. Growth: Continued gradual decline in length percentile. Weight percentile
   relatively stable. Will continue to monitor.
5. Early intervention ongoing with modest gains in speech and limited gains
   in gross motor.

PLAN:
1. Defer comprehensive diagnostic assessment to developmental pediatrics
   (appointment October 1, 2014).
2. Continue early intervention services — PT and speech therapy.
3. Provided mother with staring spell diary to bring to developmental
   pediatrics appointment.
4. Discussed concerns at length with mother. She is tearful but appreciative
   of the upcoming specialist evaluation.
5. Will obtain developmental pediatrics report and follow up.
6. Next well-child visit at 36 months.

OFFICE VISIT — 36-MONTH VISIT
Date of Service: March 18, 2015
Patient Age: 36 months 3 days (3 years)
ICD-10: Z00.129, F80.2, R62.0, R29.3, F98.4
CPT: 99392

SUBJECTIVE:
Mother brings Eli for 3-year well-child visit. Developmental pediatrics
initial evaluation is now scheduled for April 1, 2015 (original October 2014
appointment was rescheduled twice due to provider illness and scheduling
conflicts — mother is frustrated by the delay). [Note: Total wait from
referral to appointment = approximately 12 months.]

Mother reports:
- Vocabulary: Has NOT significantly expanded beyond approximately 25 words.
  "If anything, he might have lost a word or two — he used to say 'shoe' and
  'car' but I haven't heard those in weeks." Still no consistent two-word
  combinations. Spontaneous language use remains limited.
- Hand-wringing: Now frequent — mother estimates >10 episodes per day, each
  lasting 15-45 seconds. "He does it constantly now. Whenever he's not
  actively playing with something, his hands go right to it."
- Toe-walking: Persistent, approximately 40% of the time.
- Staring spells: Continuing, now 1-2 per day per mother's report. Duration
  unchanged at 5-10 seconds. Mother shows diary — she documented 38 episodes
  over the past month.
- Balance: "He falls a lot. More than other kids his age. He trips on things
  that other kids walk over easily."
- Mother states: "I feel like something is really wrong and nobody is helping
  us. I've been waiting for over a year to see the specialist. I keep being
  told to wait and I feel like we're losing time."
- Sleep: Generally sleeping well. Occasional night waking but returns to
  sleep. No seizure-like activity during sleep per mother's observation.
- Diet: Eating well. Enjoys soft foods. Prefers to eat with fingers rather
  than utensils. Drinks whole milk and water.
- ABA therapy: Was recommended by early intervention team but waitlisted.
  Not yet started.

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:
  Weight: 28 lbs 8 oz (12.93 kg) — 32nd percentile
  Length: 36.0 inches (91.4 cm) — 26th percentile
  Head Circumference: 49.2 cm — 30th percentile
  Temperature: 98.4 F (36.9 C)
  Heart Rate: 100 bpm
  Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/min

General: Quiet toddler. Walking in exam room. Wide-based gait with
intermittent toe-walking. Observed hand-wringing twice during visit (once
while seated, once while standing — stopped wringing to accept toy, then
resumed when toy was put down).

Physical Exam: Unremarkable. No dysmorphic features. Eyes: Visual acuity not
formally testable — appears to track and fixate. Ears: Clear. Heart, lungs,
abdomen: within normal limits. No hepatosplenomegaly. Skin: Clear. GU: Normal.

Neurological:
  - Gait: As described. Falls seen once during visit (tripped on own foot
    while turning).
  - Tone: Lower extremities appear mildly hypotonic on today's exam. Upper
    extremities — normal.
  - Reflexes: 2+ bilateral upper and lower extremities. Plantars flexor.
  - Hand-wringing: Stereotypic quality — repetitive, rhythmic, bilateral,
    occurs at midline. Not goal-directed. Does not appear voluntary.
  - No staring episodes observed during visit.
  - Cranial nerves: Grossly intact. Face symmetric. Gag intact. Tongue
    midline.

Developmental:
  - Language: Said "mama" and "no" during visit. Made non-specific
    vocalizations. No phrases observed.
  - Social: Brief eye contact with examiner. Watched mother's face when she
    was speaking. Did not initiate interaction with examiner or show/point
    at objects.
  - Fine motor: Scribbled with crayon. Did not attempt to copy circle. Turned
    pages of book. Pincer grasp intact.
  - Gross motor: As above. Cannot jump. Climbs stairs with rail, both feet
    on each step.

ASSESSMENT:
1. 36-month-old male with significant, persistent developmental delays in
   multiple domains (language, gross motor, fine motor) with progressive
   stereotypic behaviors (hand-wringing) and recurrent staring spells.
2. Concern is escalating. Vocabulary appears to have plateaued and may be
   regressing. Motor skills are not progressing at expected rate despite
   intervention. Staring spells are increasing in frequency.
3. Developmental pediatrics evaluation now scheduled for April 1, 2015 (age
   3 years, 2 weeks). This evaluation is critically needed.
4. Growth: Continued downward trend in percentiles, particularly length
   (now 26th from 52nd at birth).

PLAN:
1. Defer comprehensive diagnostic assessment to developmental pediatrics
   appointment in 2 weeks. Expressed to scheduling at Children's Developmental
   Center the urgency of maintaining this appointment without further delays.
2. Continue early intervention PT and speech services.
3. Instructed mother to bring staring spell diary, all therapy reports, and
   growth chart to developmental pediatrics visit.
4. Extended counseling with mother (visit time 40 minutes). Validated her
   concerns and frustration with wait times. "You are right to be concerned,
   and I want you to know we are taking this seriously."
5. Deferred vision and hearing screening to developmental pediatrics visit
   (more comprehensive testing available there).
6. Next visit: Post-specialist follow-up or 3.5-year check.

INITIAL COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENTAL EVALUATION
Date of Service: April 1, 2015
Patient Age: 3 years, 0 months, 17 days
ICD-10 (Final): F84.0 (Autism Spectrum Disorder), F70 (Mild Intellectual
Disability), R62.0 (Delayed milestone in childhood), R29.3 (Abnormal posture)
CPT: 99205 (New patient, high complexity), 96116 x 3 (Neurobehavioral status
exam), 96112 (Developmental test administration), 96113 x 2 (each additional
30 min)

                    DEVELOPMENTAL EVALUATION REPORT

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:
Eli Marcus Reeves is a 3-year-0-month-old biracial (Black/White) male referred
by his primary care pediatrician, Dr. Sarah Mitchell of Greenfield Pediatrics,
for comprehensive developmental evaluation due to concerns regarding delayed
language development, gross motor delays, stereotypic hand-wringing behaviors,
brief staring episodes, and a positive M-CHAT-R/F screening at 24 months.

This evaluation was conducted over two sessions (April 1 and April 3, 2015),
totaling approximately 4.5 hours of direct clinical contact, in addition to
record review and scoring time. The evaluation was attended by Eli, his mother
(Denise Reeves), and his father (Marcus Reeves) on April 1. Mother alone
attended the April 3 session.

REFERRAL CONCERNS:
Per referral documentation and parent interview:
1. Delayed gross motor milestones (walking achieved at approximately 26 months)
2. Delayed expressive language (~25 words, no consistent phrases at 36 months)
3. Delayed receptive language (inconsistent following of commands, limited
   identification of objects/body parts)
4. Repetitive hand-wringing/washing movements (>10 episodes/day)
5. Intermittent staring episodes (1-2/day, 5-10 seconds duration)
6. Intermittent toe-walking
7. Wide-based, uncoordinated gait with frequent falls
8. Positive M-CHAT-R/F at 24 months (6/20, 3 critical failures)

DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:

Prenatal/Birth History: Pregnancy uncomplicated. Spontaneous vaginal delivery
at 39+2 weeks after elective induction. APGAR 8/9. Birth weight 7 lbs 6 oz.
No NICU stay. Passed newborn hearing screen and metabolic screen. No neonatal
complications.

Developmental Milestones (per parent report and medical records):

Attends home daycare 3 mornings/week.

BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:

Eli was observed over two sessions totaling 4.5 hours. He arrived for the first
session in his mother's arms and was reluctant to separate initially but did
transition to the testing room with both parents present.

Appearance: Well-groomed, appropriately dressed boy. Appeared well-nourished.
No dysmorphic features noted.

Activity Level and Behavior: Eli was intermittently cooperative with testing
demands. He demonstrated periods of engagement with test materials, interspersed
with periods of disinterest and self-directed activity. He frequently returned
to hand-wringing behavior when not actively engaged with materials or when
between test items. The hand-wringing was stereotypic in nature — rhythmic,
bilateral, occurring at midline, involving a repetitive rubbing/wringing motion
of the hands. This behavior was observed approximately 12-15 times across the
two testing sessions and appeared to be a default resting behavior when hands
were not otherwise occupied. The behavior did not appear to be associated with
distress or emotional arousal; rather, it occurred in a variety of contexts and
emotional states. This stereotypic behavior is consistent with the restricted/
repetitive behavior domain described in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Gait and Motor Observations: Eli walked independently with a wide-based gait.
Toe-walking was observed intermittently (estimated 30-40% of steps). When
walking flat-footed, his gait appeared mildly uncoordinated with reduced arm
swing. He tripped and fell once during the first session while walking across
the room. He had difficulty navigating a step up into the testing room (required
hand-held assistance). His overall motor coordination appeared below age
expectations.

Language and Communication: Eli used approximately 8-10 recognizable words
during the evaluation sessions combined. He used "mama" frequently, "no"
several times, "more" during snack time, and "ball" when presented with a ball
during testing. Utterances were single words only — no multi-word combinations
were observed. Non-verbal communication was limited: he did not use pointing to
share interest (protodeclarative pointing absent), though he occasionally
reached toward desired objects. He did bring a toy car to his mother once
(possible showing behavior, though ambiguous — may have been requesting
assistance rather than sharing). He did not follow a point across the room
consistently (successful on approximately 2/6 trials). He did not direct the
examiner's attention to objects or events.

Eye Contact and Social Engagement: Eye contact was present but inconsistent and
often fleeting. Eli made eye contact most frequently with his mother and less
so with the examiner. During structured one-on-one interactions (e.g., ball
play, book-sharing), he demonstrated more sustained eye contact and social
engagement. During unstructured periods, he tended to engage in solitary
activity (manipulating a toy, hand-wringing) without seeking social interaction.
He did not demonstrate imaginative or pretend play — his play was largely
functional (rolling a car, stacking blocks) or sensorimotor (mouthing objects,
spinning wheels of a toy car).

Attention and Engagement: Two notable episodes of apparent disengagement were
observed during testing:

  Episode 1 (Session 1, approximately 45 minutes into evaluation): Eli was
  seated at the table during Bayley-III cognitive items. He suddenly ceased
  activity, eyes became fixed in a forward gaze, and he was unresponsive to
  the examiner calling his name twice and to a light touch on his shoulder
  from his mother. The episode lasted approximately 7-8 seconds. He then
  blinked, looked down at the test materials, and resumed manipulating the
  blocks without any apparent confusion, disorientation, or distress.

  Episode 2 (Session 2, approximately 30 minutes into evaluation): During
  ADOS-2 Module 1 administration, Eli was engaged in free play with a set
  of toys. He stopped playing, stared fixedly at the wall, and was again
  unresponsive to his name for approximately 5-6 seconds. He then resumed
  playing, picking up the toy he had put down. Mother noted, "That's one of
  his staring spells — he does that all the time."

  Clinical Impression Regarding Staring Episodes: These episodes presented
  as brief periods of apparent inattention and disengagement lasting
  approximately 5-8 seconds, during which the child was unresponsive to
  auditory and tactile stimuli. Upon resolution, the child returned to his
  prior activity without evidence of postictal confusion, distress, or
  disorientation. While the possibility of absence seizures can be considered
  in the differential, the clinical presentation is more consistent with
  dissociative or inattentive episodes as commonly observed in children with
  Autism Spectrum Disorder. The brief duration, lack of motor phenomena (no
  eye blinking, lip smacking, automatisms, or tonic/clonic activity), lack
  of postictal state, and the context of occurring in a child with an
  emerging autism presentation make these episodes most consistent with ASD-
  related disengagement. An EEG is not recommended at this time, though this
  may be reconsidered if episodes change in character, increase significantly
  in frequency or duration, or if motor phenomena develop.

     Classification: Significantly Below Average

   Summary: Eli demonstrated significantly below average performance across
   all Bayley-III domains. Cognitive abilities fall in the borderline range.
   Language is the area of greatest deficit, with expressive language more
   severely affected than receptive. Motor skills are also significantly
   below average, with gross motor more impaired than fine motor.

     Fine Motor v-Scale Score: 10
   Adaptive Behavior Composite: 67 (95% CI: 62-72)
     Percentile Rank: 1st
     Classification: Significantly Below Average

   Summary: Vineland-3 results indicate significantly below average adaptive
   functioning across all domains, with socialization as the area of greatest
   relative weakness and daily living skills as a relative (though still
   impaired) strength. These results are consistent with an individual
   requiring substantial support across environments.

NEUROIMAGING:

MRI Brain without contrast, ordered as part of this evaluation. Performed
April 8, 2015 at VCU Medical Center, Department of Radiology.
Read by: Thomas Brennan, MD (General Diagnostic Radiologist)

Report excerpt:
  "FINDINGS: The brain parenchyma demonstrates normal signal intensity on
  all sequences. No focal lesion, mass, or area of restricted diffusion.
  Gray-white matter differentiation is normal. No evidence of cortical
  malformation. The ventricular system is normal in size and configuration.
  No hydrocephalus. The corpus callosum is intact and of normal morphology.
  The posterior fossa structures, including cerebellum and brainstem, are
  normal in appearance. No Chiari malformation. Myelination pattern is
  appropriate for age. No abnormal enhancement. No extra-axial collections.

  IMPRESSION: Normal MRI of the brain for age. No structural abnormality
  identified."

[Clinical note: MRI read by general radiologist. Not reviewed by pediatric
neuroradiologist. Subtle early findings of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
(cerebellar volume changes, periventricular white matter signal changes) may
not be detectable at this age and/or may require specialized neuroradiology
interpretation.]

DIAGNOSTIC FORMULATION AND IMPRESSIONS:

Based on comprehensive evaluation including clinical interview, behavioral
observation, standardized assessment, physical/neurological examination, and
neuroimaging, the following diagnostic impressions are offered:

1. AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD), DSM-5 299.00 (F84.0)
   Severity: Level 2 — Requiring Substantial Support

   Specifiers:
   - With accompanying intellectual impairment
   - With accompanying language impairment

   Justification: Eli meets DSM-5 criteria for ASD based on the following:

   Criterion A — Persistent deficits in social communication and social
   interaction across multiple contexts:
   A1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity: Limited social overtures,
       reduced sharing of interests and emotions, limited initiation of
       social interaction.
   A2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors: Poorly modulated eye
       contact, limited use of gestures (pointing for sharing absent),
       limited integration of verbal and nonverbal communication.
   A3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships:
       Limited engagement with peers, absence of imaginative/pretend play,
       limited interest in social interaction beyond immediate needs.

   Criterion B — Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or
   activities:
   B1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements: Hand-wringing stereotypy
       is prominent and frequent.
   B2. Insistence on sameness: Not prominently observed during evaluation,
       though mother reports some preference for routine at home.
   B3. Highly restricted, fixated interests: Spinning wheels of toy car
       for extended periods. Limited play repertoire.
   B4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input: Not prominently observed
       during evaluation.

   At least 2/4 B criteria met (B1, B3).

   Criterion C: Symptoms present in early developmental period — confirmed.
   Criterion D: Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment — confirmed.
   Criterion E: Not better explained by intellectual disability alone — the
   social communication deficits exceed what would be expected based on
   cognitive level alone. ADOS-2 comparison score of 7 supports moderate
   ASD symptom severity.

   Level 2 justification: Eli requires substantial support. He demonstrates
   marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication, social
   impairments apparent even with supports in place, limited initiation of
   social interactions, and reduced or abnormal response to social overtures.
   Restricted/repetitive behaviors are frequent and obvious to the casual
   observer (hand-wringing) and interfere with functioning in multiple
   contexts.

2. INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, MILD (F70)
   Bayley-III Cognitive Composite: 72 (borderline range)
   Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite: 67 (significantly below average)
   Functioning level is consistent with mild intellectual disability given
   scores approximating 2 standard deviations below the mean across both
   cognitive and adaptive measures.

3. MIXED RECEPTIVE-EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE DISORDER (F80.2)
   Significant language delays in both receptive and expressive domains,
   beyond what is accounted for by cognitive level and ASD.

4. MOTOR DELAYS (R62.0) with intermittent toe-walking (R29.3)
   Gross motor more affected than fine motor. Wide-based gait. Etiology
   attributed to overall developmental profile in context of ASD with
   associated motor impairment.

5. STEREOTYPIC MOVEMENT DISORDER (noted as feature of ASD, Criterion B1)
   Hand-wringing is classified within the ASD diagnosis rather than as a
   separate stereotypic movement disorder, as it is best understood as a
   restricted/repetitive behavior within the autism presentation.

6. STARING SPELLS — ETIOLOGY UNCLEAR
   As detailed in behavioral observations, two episodes of brief
   disengagement (5-8 seconds) were observed. Clinical presentation is most
   consistent with dissociative/inattentive episodes as commonly seen in
   ASD. EEG not recommended at this time. Parents to continue monitoring
   and report any change in character.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy: 25-30 hours per week recommended.
   Eli's profile warrants intensive, evidence-based behavioral intervention
   targeting social communication, play skills, functional language, and
   reduction of interfering stereotypic behaviors. Recommend provider with
   experience in Level 2 ASD with co-occurring intellectual disability.

2. Speech-Language Therapy: Increase to 2 times per week (individual sessions,
   30-45 minutes each). Focus on functional communication, vocabulary
   expansion, requesting, and initiation of communication. Consider
   augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) — picture exchange system
   (PECS) or speech-generating device trial if verbal language does not
   progress within 3-6 months.

3. Occupational Therapy: Initiate OT 1 time per week to address fine motor
   development, sensory processing, and self-help skills (feeding, dressing).

4. Physical Therapy: Continue current PT services 1 time per week for gait
   training, balance, coordination, and toe-walking management. Consider
   serial casting or orthotics if toe-walking persists.

5. Special Education: Eli is eligible for special education preschool services
   under IDEA Part B (transitioning from Part C). Recommend placement in a
   structured special education preschool program with low student-to-teacher
   ratio, speech and language support embedded, and ASD-specific programming.
   An IEP should be developed immediately.

6. Neuroimaging: MRI brain completed — normal for age.

7. Follow-Up: Return to this clinic in 6 months for reassessment of progress
   and treatment response. May consider additional genetic or metabolic testing
   if progress is not commensurate with intervention intensity.

8. Family Support: Provided information on local ASD parent support groups
   (Autism Society of Central Virginia). Discussed available TRICARE benefits
   for ASD-related services (family has military insurance through father's
   active duty status).

This evaluation was discussed in detail with both parents. They expressed
understanding of the diagnosis and plan. Mother was tearful but stated she
"finally has an answer." Father asked about the cause — I explained that ASD
is a neurodevelopmental condition with likely genetic underpinnings, that it
is not caused by parenting or environmental factors, and that the cause in
most cases is not identifiable through a single test. I noted that genetic
testing (chromosomal microarray, Fragile X) could be considered but is
optional at this stage and can be discussed at the follow-up visit.

6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP VISIT
Date of Service: October 7, 2015
Patient Age: 3 years, 6 months, 22 days
ICD-10: F84.0 (ASD), F70, F80.2, R29.3
CPT: 99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity)

SUBJECTIVE:
Mother brings Eli for 6-month follow-up after ASD diagnosis.

Services update:
- ABA therapy: Started June 2015 through Behavioral Pathways, Inc. Currently
  receiving 20 hours/week (unable to access full 25-30 recommended due to
  provider availability). Mother reports "mixed" progress. ABA supervisor
  reports Eli is "cooperative but makes inconsistent gains." Targets include
  requesting (manding), eye contact, imitation, and reducing hand-wringing.
  Manding with PECS has been partially introduced — Eli can exchange 1 picture
  card for a preferred item approximately 50% of trials. Verbal requesting
  has not increased.
- Speech therapy: 2x/week individual sessions. Therapist reports vocabulary
  has expanded minimally to approximately 28-30 words but spontaneous use
  remains limited. No consistent two-word combinations despite 6 months of
  focused intervention. Therapist has recommended AAC device trial.
- OT: 1x/week. Addressing fine motor and self-help skills. Some progress
  with spoon use and hand-over-hand dressing tasks.
- PT: 1x/week. Toe-walking persists. Gait remains wide-based.
- Special education preschool: Enrolled in district-based ASD classroom since
  August 2015 (beginning of school year). Teacher reports he is "quiet,
  compliant, but not engaging much with peers."

Mother concerns today:
- "The ABA isn't really working the way I thought it would. He's been doing it
  for 4 months and I don't see big changes."
- "The hand-wringing hasn't gotten better at all — if anything, it's worse."
- "He's still having those staring spells. I think they might be more frequent
  now — maybe 2-3 times a day." Mother reports spells are unchanged in
  character: 5-10 seconds, staring, unresponsive, then resumes activity.
- Mother asks directly: "Could these be seizures? I looked it up online and
  absence seizures look exactly like what Eli does."

Father is present at this visit. He is quieter but nods in agreement with
mother's concerns. He asks: "Is there something else going on besides autism?"

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:
  Weight: 31 lbs 4 oz (14.17 kg) — 33rd percentile
  Height: 38.5 inches (97.8 cm) — 26th percentile
  Head Circumference: 49.5 cm — 28th percentile
  Temperature: 98.4 F axillary

General: Alert boy. Walking with wide-based gait. Toe-walking observed. Hand-
wringing observed 4 times during 30-minute visit. Eye contact fleeting.

Neurological: Tone — mildly reduced in lower extremities (more apparent today
than at initial evaluation — may be progressive or may represent better
cooperation with examination). Upper extremity tone normal. Reflexes 2+
symmetric. No clonus. Plantars flexor. Gait wide-based, intermittent toe-
walking. No ataxia per se but mild clumsiness with direction changes. Hand-
wringing prominent.

Language: Used "mama" and "no." No other words observed during visit. Made
non-specific vocalizations.

Social: Brief eye contact with examiner. More engaged with mother. Did not
initiate interaction with examiner.

ASSESSMENT:
1. ASD Level 2 with co-occurring mild intellectual disability — progress
   with intensive intervention has been modest. This is not unexpected at
   this stage. ABA benefit often takes 6-12 months to fully manifest.
2. Hand-wringing stereotypy — unchanged/possibly increased. This is a common
   and often persistent stereotypic behavior in ASD.
3. Staring episodes — parents continue to report. Frequency may be increasing
   (now 2-3/day per parent report). Mother specifically asks about absence
   seizures. Discussion with parents:

   "I understand your concern about seizures. The staring episodes Eli
   experiences are brief, non-convulsive, and he returns to baseline without
   confusion or distress. While absence seizures are in the differential,
   these episodes are consistent with dissociative or inattentive episodes
   that are commonly seen in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
   Children with ASD frequently experience brief episodes of apparent
   disengagement, particularly during periods of sensory overload or
   during transitions between activities. There is no clinical indication
   for epilepsy at this time, as the episodes are brief and non-convulsive
   with no associated motor phenomena. I would not recommend an EEG at this
   time. However, if the episodes change in character — for example, if
   they become longer, if you see eye rolling, lip smacking, or body
   stiffening, or if they increase significantly in frequency — please
   contact our office and we can reconsider."

4. Growth: Height percentile continues gradual decline (now 26th). Weight
   more stable. Head circumference 28th — also declining from earlier
   measurements. Pattern is notable and will continue to be monitored.

PLAN:
1. Continue ABA therapy — encourage increasing to full 25-30 hours/week if
   provider availability allows. Request updated treatment plan from BCBA.
   ABA program should incorporate specific protocols to address stereotypic
   hand-wringing through differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors
   (DRA) and response interruption/redirection (RIRD).
2. Continue speech therapy 2x/week. Support AAC device trial as recommended
   by SLP.
3. Continue OT and PT.
4. Continue special education preschool.
5. Staring spells: Continue monitoring. Diary maintenance. No EEG at this
   time.
6. Genetic testing: Discussed with parents. Offered chromosomal microarray
   and Fragile X testing. Parents defer at this time — "We want to see how
   he does with therapy first." Explained that genetic testing would not
   change the current treatment plan but could provide etiologic information.
   Parents to consider and may pursue at follow-up.
7. Parents report they are expecting a military reassignment (PCS) to Fort
   Wright, Ohio, likely in the next 3-6 months. Will prepare transfer of
   care documentation when timing is confirmed.
8. Follow-up: 6 months, or sooner if concerns escalate.

    TRICARE Prime, Sponsor: SSG Marcus Reeves (AD, US Army)

Dear Colleague,

I am writing to provide a comprehensive summary of care for Eli Reeves, who is
transferring out of our area due to a military Permanent Change of Station
(PCS) to Fort Wright, Ohio. This letter summarizes his developmental history,
diagnostic evaluation, and current treatment plan.

DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY:
Eli was evaluated at our center in April 2015 (age 3 years, 0 months) and
received the following diagnoses:

1. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), DSM-5 299.00 (F84.0)
   Severity Level: Level 2 — Requiring Substantial Support
   With accompanying intellectual impairment
   With accompanying language impairment

2. Mild Intellectual Disability (F70)

3. Mixed Receptive-Expressive Language Disorder (F80.2)

4. Motor Delays with intermittent toe-walking

EVALUATION FINDINGS (April 2015):
- ADOS-2 Module 1: SA + RRB Total = 17 (exceeds Autism cutoff of 16).
  Comparison Score: 7.
- Bayley-III: Cognitive 72, Language 65, Motor 68.
- Vineland-3: Communication 68, DLS 72, Socialization 62, Motor 70.
  Adaptive Behavior Composite: 67.
- MRI Brain (April 2015): Normal for age.
- Basic metabolic panel, CBC, thyroid function, lead: All normal.
- Hearing screen: Passed (OAE).
- Genetic testing: Offered but deferred by parents.

KEY CLINICAL FEATURES:
Eli meets DSM-5 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 2. His
presentation is characterized by:
- Significantly delayed expressive and receptive language (currently ~28-30
  words, no consistent phrases at age 3 years 10 months)
- Limited social communication (reduced eye contact, absent protodeclarative
  pointing, limited joint attention)
- Prominent hand-wringing stereotypy (repetitive, bilateral, rhythmic hand-
  wringing/washing movements occurring >10 times daily; this is the most
  prominent restricted/repetitive behavior in his presentation)
- Intermittent staring episodes (5-10 seconds, 2-3 times daily per parent
  report; clinically assessed as dissociative/inattentive episodes consistent
  with ASD rather than epileptiform activity; EEG not performed)
- Gross motor delays with wide-based gait and intermittent bilateral toe-
  walking
- Mild intellectual disability on formal testing

The hand-wringing stereotypies and intermittent disengagement episodes are
characteristic of his autism presentation. I recommend continuation of
intensive ABA therapy and speech-language services as the cornerstone of his
treatment program.

CURRENT SERVICES:
- ABA therapy: 20 hours/week (recommended 25-30 hours/week; increase if
  possible). Provider: Behavioral Pathways, Inc., Richmond, VA.
- Speech-Language Therapy: 2x/week individual sessions.
- Occupational Therapy: 1x/week.
- Physical Therapy: 1x/week.
- Special Education: Enrolled in ASD-specific preschool classroom through
  Richmond City Public Schools. Current IEP on file with school district.

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
1. Establish care with a developmental-behavioral pediatrician or pediatric
   neurologist in the receiving area for ongoing monitoring.
2. Continue ABA at maximum recommended intensity.
3. Continue speech therapy with consideration of AAC device trial if verbal
   language does not progress.
4. Continue OT and PT.
5. Monitor staring episodes. If they change in character, increase in
   frequency or duration, or if motor phenomena develop, EEG should be
   considered at that time.
6. Genetic testing (chromosomal microarray, Fragile X) may be considered
   at the discretion of the receiving provider. Parents have thus far
   deferred.
7. Monitor growth trajectory — percentiles have been gradually declining
   (height now ~26th percentile, head circumference ~28th). May warrant
   nutritional assessment if trend continues.
8. Next comprehensive developmental reassessment recommended at approximately
   age 4.5-5 years, or sooner if significant clinical changes occur.

I would be happy to discuss Eli's case by telephone if you have any questions.

PHYSICAL THERAPY INITIAL EVALUATION
Date of Service: October 15, 2013
Patient Age: 19 months, 30 days (approximately 20 months)
Evaluating Therapist: Karen Lindstrom, PT, DPT, PCS (Pediatric Certified
  Specialist)
ICD-10: R62.0 (Delayed milestone in childhood)
CPT: 97163 (PT evaluation, high complexity)

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:
Eli Reeves is a 20-month-old male referred by his pediatrician (Dr. Sarah
Mitchell, Greenfield Pediatrics) through the Virginia Infant & Toddler
Connection for physical therapy evaluation due to gross motor delays.
Specifically, he is not yet walking independently at 20 months of age.

HISTORY:
Per parent report and medical records: Full-term birth, uncomplicated delivery.
Early motor milestones achieved within normal limits (rolling at 3.5 months,
sitting independently at 7 months). Crawling onset at 10.5 months. Pulling to
stand at 12 months. Cruising along furniture at approximately 14.5 months.
Currently cruising well but has not taken independent steps. Parents report he
will stand independently for 2-3 seconds before sitting down.

No history of regression in motor skills. No seizure history (parents report
brief "zoning out" episodes but these have not been formally evaluated). No
orthopedic history. No known genetic or metabolic conditions.

ASSESSMENT:

Gross Motor Evaluation (Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2, Gross Motor
subtest):
  Gross Motor Quotient: 73 (Mean = 100, SD = 15)
  Age Equivalent: 13 months (chronological age: 20 months)
  Classification: Below Average

Specific findings:
- Stationary: Sits independently with good balance. Transitions between
  sitting and prone/supine smoothly. Pulls to stand on furniture. Stands
  holding on with one hand.
- Locomotion: Crawls reciprocally on hands and knees — well-coordinated.
  Cruises along furniture with lateral stepping pattern. Walks with two
  hands held. Walks with one hand held — emerging, inconsistent (takes 4-5
  steps then loses balance). NOT walking independently. NOT climbing stairs.
- Object Manipulation: Throws ball forward (underhand) — emerging. Kicks ball
  — not yet.

Gait Observation (with hand-held assistance):
  - Wide base of support (inter-malleolar distance approximately 6 inches —
    wider than expected for age)
  - Bilateral toe-walking observed on approximately 40% of steps during
    hand-held walking
  - Reduced arm swing
  - Trunk rotation diminished
  - Balance reactions (lateral protective) — delayed; compensatory stepping
    reactions inconsistent

Tone Assessment:
  - Upper extremities: Normal tone throughout range of motion.
  - Lower extremities: Mild hypotonia noted on passive assessment —
    particularly at the hip girdle. Decreased resistance to passive movement
    at hips and knees compared to age expectations.
  - Trunk: Mild axial hypotonia — reduced trunk stability during dynamic
    activities (e.g., reaching in standing).

Range of Motion:
  - Bilateral ankles: Full dorsiflexion to 15 degrees past neutral with knee
    extended and flexed. No Achilles contracture. Toe-walking appears habitual/
    behavioral rather than secondary to musculoskeletal restriction.

Strength:
  - Formal manual muscle testing not performed due to age. Functional
    strength assessment: hip abductors and extensors appear mildly weak
    based on Trendelenburg-type pattern observed during assisted walking.
    Quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexors appear functional.

Balance:
  - Static standing balance (with support): Good.
  - Dynamic balance: Poor. Loses balance with minimal perturbation in
    standing. Protective reactions (forward, lateral, backward) inconsistent
    and delayed.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
Eli presents with significant gross motor delay, with a gross motor age
equivalent of approximately 13 months at a chronological age of 20 months
(7-month delay). His motor profile is characterized by: (1) delayed
acquisition of independent walking; (2) wide-based gait pattern with
intermittent bilateral toe-walking; (3) delayed balance reactions; and
(4) mild generalized hypotonia, most prominent in axial and lower extremity
musculature. The hypotonia may be contributing to the wide-based gait pattern
as a compensatory mechanism for reduced postural stability.

GOALS (6-MONTH):
1. Eli will walk independently across a 15-foot room without hand-held
   assistance in 3 out of 5 trials.
2. Eli will demonstrate flat-footed walking >70% of the time during a
   10-minute observation period.
3. Eli will recover balance from mild lateral perturbation in standing
   without falling in 4 out of 5 trials.
4. Eli will climb 3 stairs with one hand on railing and minimal assist.

PLAN:
Direct PT services 1x/week, 45-minute sessions.
Treatment will include:
- Weight-bearing and balance activities in standing
- Gait training with progressive reduction of support
- Heel cord stretching and sensory input to feet to discourage toe-walking
- Hip and core strengthening through functional play activities
- Balance reaction training
- Parent education on home exercise program

SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY INITIAL EVALUATION
Date of Service: October 17, 2013
Patient Age: 20 months 2 days
Evaluating Therapist: Angela Torres, MS, CCC-SLP
ICD-10: F80.2 (Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder)
CPT: 92523 (SLP evaluation, comprehensive)

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:
Eli Reeves is a 20-month-old male referred for speech-language evaluation
through Virginia Infant & Toddler Connection due to concerns about delayed
language development. Referral from Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Greenfield Pediatrics.

HISTORY:
Per parent report and medical records: First words appeared at approximately
12 months ("mama," "dada," "no"). Vocabulary slowly expanded to approximately
12 words by 18 months. Mother reports vocabulary growth has slowed in recent
months. No two-word combinations. Uses some gestures (reaching, inconsistent
waving). Does not consistently point to share interest. Sometimes does not
respond to name. Hearing screen passed at 6 months (OAE).

ASSESSMENT:

Preschool Language Scales, Fifth Edition (PLS-5):
  Auditory Comprehension Standard Score: 74 (Mean = 100, SD = 15)
    Age Equivalent: 14 months
    Percentile Rank: 4th
  Expressive Communication Standard Score: 68 (Mean = 100, SD = 15)
    Age Equivalent: 12 months
    Percentile Rank: 2nd
  Total Language Standard Score: 70 (Mean = 100, SD = 15)
    Percentile Rank: 2nd
    Classification: Significantly Below Average

MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) — Words and Gestures
(completed by mother):
  Words Understood: 85 (below 10th percentile for 20 months)
  Words Produced: 14 (below 5th percentile for 20 months)
  Total Gestures: 28/63 (below 10th percentile for 20 months)

Oral-Motor Examination:
  Oral structures: Within normal limits. Lips, tongue, palate, dentition —
  all normal. Tongue mobility adequate. No drooling. Oral-motor coordination
  for feeding — adequate per parent report (eating table foods, using sippy
  cup). Velopharyngeal function appears adequate. No oral-motor apraxia
  suspected at this time, though assessment is limited by age and cooperation.

Speech Sound Inventory:
  Consonant sounds produced during evaluation: /m/, /b/, /d/, /n/. Limited
  consonant repertoire. Vowel production appears adequate. Syllable shapes:
  primarily CV (e.g., "ma," "ba," "no") and CVCV reduplicative (e.g., "mama,"
  "dada"). No consonant clusters. No final consonants observed.

Pragmatic/Social Communication Observations:
  - Eye contact: Present but inconsistent.
  - Requesting: Reaches toward desired objects. Occasional use of "more" in
    context. Does not yet point to request consistently.
  - Protodeclarative pointing (pointing to share interest): ABSENT.
  - Joint attention (following point): Inconsistent — follows point
    approximately 40% of attempts.
  - Showing/giving objects: Not observed.
  - Response to name: Inconsistent (3/6 trials).
  - Turn-taking in vocal play: Emerging — occasional vocal back-and-forth
    but brief.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
Eli presents with a mixed receptive-expressive language delay, with both
comprehension and production significantly below age expectations. Expressive
language is more severely affected than receptive. His vocabulary of
approximately 12-14 words at 20 months is significantly below the expected
50th percentile of approximately 50 words. Social communication skills are
also delayed, with absent protodeclarative pointing and inconsistent joint
attention. These social communication deficits raise concern for a possible
autism spectrum condition, which should be evaluated by a developmental
specialist.

GOALS (6-MONTH):
1. Eli will expand expressive vocabulary to at least 30 words used
   spontaneously across settings.
2. Eli will use pointing (index finger) to request desired items in 4 out
   of 5 opportunities.
3. Eli will respond to his name by orienting toward the speaker in 4 out
   of 5 trials.
4. Eli will follow one-step commands without gestural cues in 3 out of 5
   trials.
5. Eli will initiate a communicative act (verbal or gestural) to gain
   adult attention at least 5 times per 30-minute session.

PLAN:
Direct speech-language therapy services 2x/week, 30-minute sessions.
Treatment will include:
- Vocabulary expansion through naturalistic and structured activities
- Prompting and reinforcing communicative intent (pointing, gestures, words)
- Joint attention and social communication activities
- Receptive language activities (following commands, identifying objects)
- Parent coaching for language-rich home environment

PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRESS SUMMARY
Reporting Period: October 2013 — April 2014 (Ages 20-25 months)
Therapist: Karen Lindstrom, PT, DPT, PCS
ICD-10: R62.0
CPT: 97110, 97530, 97116 (weekly sessions)

PATIENT: Eli Reeves | DOB: 03/15/2012 | MRN: VITC-R-2013-5582

ATTENDANCE: 22 of 24 scheduled sessions attended (2 cancellations — illness).

PROGRESS TOWARD GOALS:

Goal 1: Independent walking across 15-foot room — PARTIALLY MET.
  Eli began taking independent steps at approximately 22-23 months (December
  2013). By 25 months, he is walking independently across a room but with
  significant qualitative concerns. He can walk 15+ feet independently but
  requires 1-2 rest stops (pauses, stands still, then resumes). He falls
  approximately 2-3 times per 30-minute session, typically when turning or
  navigating around obstacles.

Goal 2: Flat-footed walking >70% of time — NOT MET.
  Toe-walking persists at approximately 30-40% of observed steps. There has
  been no significant change in toe-walking frequency despite targeted
  interventions including heel cord stretching, sensory-based foot
  activities (walking on varied textures), and ankle-foot orthosis trial
  (family declined consistent use after 2-week trial — Eli protested wearing
  the braces and mother found them difficult to manage with shoes).

Goal 3: Balance recovery from lateral perturbation — PARTIALLY MET.
  Eli can recover from very mild perturbation but continues to fall with
  moderate perturbation. Balance reactions remain delayed relative to age.
  Lateral protective extension is present but slow and inconsistent.

Goal 4: Stair climbing — NOT MET.
  Eli will ascend 2 stairs with two hands held but is not yet using a
  railing independently for stair climbing.

CURRENT FUNCTIONAL STATUS:
Eli is walking independently as of approximately 25-26 months of age. His
gait pattern, however, remains qualitatively abnormal:
  - Wide base of support (inter-malleolar distance ~5 inches)
  - Intermittent bilateral toe-walking (~30-40% of steps)
  - Reduced arm swing
  - Mildly unsteady with frequent stumbles and falls
  - Difficulty with direction changes and obstacle navigation
  - Cannot run
  - Cannot jump
  - Stair climbing requires significant assistance

Tone continues to be mildly reduced in lower extremities and trunk. No
change in tone assessment from initial evaluation.

THERAPIST'S IMPRESSION:
Eli has made progress in the primary goal of achieving independent ambulation,
which is a significant functional milestone. However, the quality of his gait
remains concerning. The persistent wide-based pattern, ongoing toe-walking,
and balance deficits suggest underlying neuromotor dysfunction beyond simple
motor delay. The mild hypotonia, delayed balance reactions, and gait
abnormalities could be consistent with a central nervous system etiology
rather than isolated developmental motor delay. I have shared these
observations with the referring physician.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue PT 1x/week, 45-minute sessions.
2. Updated goals to focus on gait quality, stair climbing, running, jumping,
   and balance.
3. Re-evaluate need for ankle-foot orthoses if toe-walking persists beyond
   age 3.
4. Recommend discussion with developmental pediatrician regarding etiology
   of motor findings.

SPEECH-LANGUAGE THERAPY PROGRESS SUMMARY
Reporting Period: October 2013 — April 2014 (Ages 20-25 months)
Therapist: Angela Torres, MS, CCC-SLP
ICD-10: F80.2
CPT: 92507 (treatment sessions, 2x/week)

PATIENT: Eli Reeves | DOB: 03/15/2012 | MRN: VITC-R-2013-5582

ATTENDANCE: 44 of 48 scheduled sessions attended (4 cancellations).

PROGRESS TOWARD GOALS:

Goal 1: Expand expressive vocabulary to 30 words — PARTIALLY MET.
  Eli's vocabulary has expanded from approximately 14 words at initial
  evaluation to approximately 22-25 words per parent report and clinical
  observation. New words added include: eat, milk, book, baby, hi, hot,
  cookie, and "uh-oh." However, the rate of acquisition has slowed over the
  past 2 months. He acquired approximately 6-8 words in the first 3 months
  of therapy but only 2-3 in the most recent 3-month period. Spontaneous
  use of words remains limited — he uses approximately 8-10 words
  consistently and the remainder are used only with prompting or in specific
  contexts. He does not use words to comment or share — word use is primarily
  for requesting.

Goal 2: Pointing to request — PARTIALLY MET.
  Eli is now using an index finger point to request desired items in
  approximately 2 out of 5 opportunities (40%). He still frequently uses
  reaching or whole-hand gestures rather than a specific point. Proto-
  declarative pointing (pointing to share interest or show something) remains
  ABSENT.

Goal 3: Respond to name — PARTIALLY MET.
  Response to name has improved to approximately 3 out of 5 trials (60%),
  up from approximately 50% at intake. However, this remains inconsistent
  and below age expectations.

Goal 4: Follow one-step commands — PARTIALLY MET.
  Eli follows simple one-step commands (e.g., "give me the cup," "sit down")
  in approximately 3 out of 5 trials during structured activities. He
  requires repetition and gestural cues in most instances. He is beginning
  to identify some body parts (points to nose and eyes with ~50% accuracy).

Goal 5: Initiate communicative acts — MINIMALLY MET.
  Eli initiates communicative acts approximately 2-3 times per 30-minute
  session, primarily through reaching, occasional pointing, and infrequent
  word use. He does not yet initiate communication to share attention,
  comment, or engage socially — initiation is limited to basic requesting.

THERAPIST'S IMPRESSION:
Eli has made inconsistent progress in speech-language therapy over the past
6 months. While his vocabulary has expanded modestly, the rate of acquisition
has decelerated rather than accelerated, which is atypical. In typically
developing children, vocabulary growth accelerates rapidly between 18-24
months (the "word explosion"), and Eli has not demonstrated this pattern. His
spontaneous use of language remains significantly limited, and his social
communication profile — including absent protodeclarative pointing, limited
joint attention, and restricted communicative functions (requesting only, no
commenting or sharing) — continues to raise concern for autism spectrum
disorder. The limited and decelerating progress despite consistent, evidence-
based intervention is concerning and suggests that his language delay may be
part of a broader neurodevelopmental condition rather than an isolated speech-
language disorder.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue speech-language therapy 2x/week.
2. Updated goals with emphasis on functional communication across settings.
3. Begin introducing PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) as an
   augmentative communication strategy given limited verbal progress.
4. Strongly recommend comprehensive developmental evaluation to clarify
   diagnostic picture and guide intervention.
5. Consider AAC device trial if verbal language does not show meaningful
   gains in the next 3-6 months.

CLIENT AGE:          4 years, 2 months
ASSESSMENT TYPE:     Comprehensive Behavioral Intake Assessment
ASSESSMENT TOOL:     Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program
                     (VB-MAPP), Sundberg 2008
REFERRING PROVIDER:  Dr. Marcus Whitfield, MD — Blue Ridge Developmental
                     Pediatrics, Roanoke, VA
REFERRAL DIAGNOSIS:  Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2 — Requiring Substantial
                     Support (ICD-10: F84.0)
ASSESSMENT SETTING:  Buckeye Behavioral Health clinic, therapy room 3
ASSESSMENT DURATION: 90 minutes (direct observation + structured probes)
PARENT PRESENT:      Yes — mother (Denise Reeves)

I. REASON FOR REFERRAL

Eli Reeves is a 4-year, 2-month-old biracial male referred for Applied Behavior
Analysis (ABA) therapy by Dr. Marcus Whitfield of Blue Ridge Developmental
Pediatrics, Roanoke, VA. Eli was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2,
at age 3 years, 6 months following developmental pediatrics evaluation. The family
recently relocated to Columbus, OH due to parental employment. Mother reports
that Eli received approximately 4 months of ABA therapy in Virginia prior to the
move but services were interrupted. Transfer records from Blue Ridge ABA Services
(Roanoke) were requested but had not been received at the time of this
assessment.

Per parent interview, primary concerns include: limited verbal communication
(approximately 15-20 words used inconsistently), repetitive hand-wringing
movements, toe-walking, "staring spells" described as brief episodes of
unresponsiveness, difficulty with peer interaction, and need for support in
adaptive daily living skills.

II. BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATION DURING ASSESSMENT

Eli was accompanied by his mother to the assessment. He did not acknowledge the
assessor upon introduction and did not make eye contact during the initial
greeting. He walked independently into the therapy room with a mildly wide-based
gait and intermittent toe-walking (estimated 40% of observed steps were on toes).

Throughout the 90-minute assessment, the following behaviors were observed:

  - Hand-wringing/hand-washing stereotypy: 14 discrete episodes observed
    (averaging >10 per 30-minute interval), each lasting 3-8 seconds. Movements
    were rhythmic, bilateral, and occurred at midline. They appeared involuntary
    and did not appear to serve a communicative or self-stimulatory function in
    the typical manner observed in our ASD population.

  - Toe-walking: Present approximately 40% of ambulatory time. Bilateral.

  - Disengagement episodes: 4 episodes observed during the 90-minute assessment.
    Duration ranged from 5 to 15 seconds. During these episodes, Eli ceased all
    motor activity, appeared to stare blankly ahead with a slight upward gaze
    deviation, and was unresponsive to his name or tactile prompts. Following
    each episode, he appeared briefly disoriented (looking around the room as if
    reorienting) before resuming activity. No convulsive movements were observed.
    Mother confirmed these episodes are consistent with what she observes at
    home, stating: "He does that all the time — we call it zoning out."

  - Verbal output: During the assessment, Eli produced 6 recognizable words
    ("mama," "no," "juice," "more," "go," "bye") in appropriate but limited
    contexts. No multi-word combinations were observed. Echolalia was minimal
    (2 instances of immediate echolalia). No delayed echolalia observed.

  - Social engagement: Eli did not initiate any social bids toward the assessor.
    He responded to his name 3 of 10 trials (30%). He oriented briefly toward
    the assessor when preferred items (bubbles, light-up toy) were presented but
    did not sustain joint attention beyond 2-3 seconds.

  - Fine motor: Eli demonstrated a crude palmar grasp on crayons. He was able
    to stack 4 blocks (mother reports he could stack 6 blocks three months ago).
    He successfully buttoned one large button on a dressing frame with moderate
    physical effort and 2 attempts.

  - Gross motor: Gait was wide-based with intermittent toe-walking as noted.
    Eli navigated the room independently. He climbed onto a child-sized chair
    without assistance. He fell once during a transition from sitting on the
    floor to standing.

V. CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS

Eli presents with significant skill deficits across all VB-MAPP domains,
consistent with his diagnosis of ASD Level 2. His overall milestone score of
31.5/170 places him primarily within the Level 1 range (developmental equivalent
of approximately 0-14 months across domains), which represents a substantial
delay for his chronological age of 4 years, 2 months.

Client demonstrates limited manding (requesting), with most mands consisting of
reaching toward desired items or leading an adult by the hand. Manding with
words was observed in only 2 instances during the assessment. Tacting (labeling)
was minimal, with Eli labeling only 3 items during structured probes (ball,
cup, bubbles). No intraverbal skills (answering questions, fill-ins, or
conversational exchanges) were observed.

Stereotypic behaviors include hand-wringing (>10 episodes per 30-minute
observation period), toe-walking, and brief apparent disengagement episodes
(4 observed during 90-minute assessment, lasting 5-15 seconds each). The
hand-wringing is notably persistent and appears qualitatively different from
typical hand-flapping stereotypy commonly observed in our ASD client population —
it is more rhythmic and washing-like in quality. The disengagement episodes are
also noteworthy; while inattention and "tuning out" are common in ASD, the
abruptness of onset, apparent unresponsiveness to stimuli, and brief post-episode
confusion are somewhat atypical.

Assessment is consistent with ASD Level 2 diagnosis per referral documentation
from Dr. Whitfield. Eli is an appropriate candidate for intensive ABA therapy
targeting manding, tacting, listener responding, imitation, and adaptive skills.

VI. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Intensive ABA therapy: 25 hours/week (5 hours/day, 5 days/week)
2. Primary focus areas:
   a. Mand training using naturalistic environment teaching (NET) and
      discrete trial training (DTT)
   b. Tact training with errorless learning procedures
   c. Listener responding expansion
   d. Motor imitation building
   e. Reduction of stereotypic behaviors through differential reinforcement
3. Data collection: Continuous frequency data on target behaviors, ABC data
   on disengagement episodes
4. Parent training: Monthly parent training sessions (2 hours/month)
5. Coordination with speech-language pathology and occupational therapy
6. Progress review: Monthly by BCBA, formal progress reports quarterly
7. Re-assessment: VB-MAPP re-administration at 6-month intervals

RECORD 3.2 — THREE-MONTH PROGRESS REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF REPORT:     08/22/2016
REPORTING PERIOD:   05/23/2016 – 08/19/2016
CLIENT AGE:         4 years, 5 months
SERVICE HOURS:      Authorized: 25 hrs/week | Delivered: 22.4 hrs/week average
                    (absences due to illness x2, family travel x1 week)
TOTAL SESSIONS:     56 sessions (approximately 280 hours)
BCBA SUPERVISION:   Monthly (4 sessions direct, 8 hours total)

I. SUMMARY OF PROGRESS

Eli has received intensive ABA services for approximately 3 months. Below is a
summary of progress toward treatment goals and updated VB-MAPP domain scores.

II. GOAL PROGRESS

Goal 1: Manding — Eli will independently mand for 10 preferred items using
vocal words or signs across 3 consecutive sessions.
  Baseline: 2 vocal mands (inconsistent)
  Current:  3 vocal mands (mama, more, juice); 1 sign (more)
  Status:   MINIMAL PROGRESS — 4 mands total vs. target of 10

Goal 2: Tacting — Eli will tact 15 common items when presented with the
item and the question "What is it?" across 2 consecutive sessions.
  Baseline: 3 tacts (ball, cup, bubbles)
  Current:  4 tacts (ball, cup, bubbles, car)
  Status:   MINIMAL PROGRESS — 1 new tact acquired in 3 months

Goal 3: Listener Responding — Eli will follow 10 one-step instructions
(e.g., "sit down," "give me the ___," "touch ___") with 80% accuracy
across 3 sessions.
  Baseline: Follows 5 instructions with 60% accuracy
  Current:  Follows 4 instructions with 55% accuracy
  Status:   REGRESSION — see note below

Goal 4: Motor Imitation — Eli will imitate 10 gross motor actions
(clap hands, stomp feet, raise arms, etc.) with 80% accuracy.
  Baseline: Imitates 6 actions with 70% accuracy
  Current:  Imitates 5 actions with 65% accuracy
  Status:   REGRESSION — see note below

Goal 5: Adaptive Skills — Eli will independently complete 3 self-care
tasks (hand washing, putting on shoes, buttoning).
  Baseline: Completes hand washing with 1 prompt; buttons large buttons
            independently; puts on shoes with moderate assistance
  Current:  Hand washing requires 2-3 prompts (increase); buttoning
            inconsistent (was independent at intake, now requires
            physical prompt 50% of trials); shoes unchanged
  Status:   REGRESSION in buttoning; NO PROGRESS in other areas

III. VB-MAPP DOMAIN SCORE COMPARISON

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Indicates score decrease (regression)

IV. NOTABLE CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS

Client has made minimal progress across all domains during this reporting
period. Of the 5 treatment goals, 2 show minimal progress, 2 show regression,
and 1 shows no change. This rate of progress is below expectations for a client
receiving 25 hours/week of intensive ABA services.

Of particular note:

  1. Listener Responding Regression: Several previously mastered listener
     responding tasks are now inconsistent. At intake, Eli could reliably
     match 4 colors (red, blue, yellow, green) on a field of 3 with 90%
     accuracy. He now matches only 2 colors (red, blue) with 75% accuracy.
     Receptive identification of body parts has also declined from 5 (head,
     eyes, nose, mouth, hands) to 3 (head, hands, mouth).

  2. Motor Imitation Decline: Eli could imitate 6 gross motor actions at
     intake. He now consistently imitates only 5, and accuracy has declined
     from 70% to 65%. Fine motor imitation (stacking patterns, placing pegs)
     has also declined.

  3. Disengagement Episodes: Frequency has remained stable at approximately
     4-6 per 3-hour session. Duration appears unchanged (5-15 seconds).
     Post-episode confusion continues to be observed.

BCBA hypothesizes that the regression in listener responding and visual
perceptual matching may be due to motivational factors, environmental change
(new home, new therapy setting, new therapists), or the transition period
associated with the family's interstate move. It is also possible that the
structured demands of intensive ABA are creating escape-motivated behavior
that presents as skill loss. RBT has been instructed to vary reinforcement
schedules and conduct preference assessments more frequently.

Plan:
  - Modify reinforcement strategies; conduct weekly preference assessments
  - Reduce demand level on regressed tasks, rebuild using errorless teaching
  - Continue data collection on disengagement episodes
  - Schedule parent conference to discuss progress concerns

RECORD 3.3 — SIX-MONTH PROGRESS REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF REPORT:     11/21/2016
REPORTING PERIOD:   08/22/2016 – 11/18/2016
CLIENT AGE:         4 years, 8 months
SERVICE HOURS:      Authorized: 25 hrs/week | Delivered: 23.1 hrs/week average
TOTAL SESSIONS:     58 sessions this period (cumulative: 114 sessions)
BCBA SUPERVISION:   Monthly (4 sessions direct, 8 hours total)

I. SUMMARY OF PROGRESS

This report documents a continued pattern of skill regression that is
increasingly concerning. Despite modifications to reinforcement strategies,
reduction in demand levels, and consultation with the clinical supervisor
(Dr. Amy Okonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D), Eli has not made measurable progress
toward any treatment goal and has demonstrably lost previously acquired
skills in multiple domains.

II. GOAL PROGRESS

Goal 1: Manding
  Baseline (05/16): 2 vocal mands
  3-month (08/16):  4 mands total (3 vocal, 1 sign)
  Current (11/16):  3 mands total (2 vocal: "mama," "more"; 1 sign: "more")
  Status:           REGRESSION — lost 1 vocal mand ("juice") acquired in
                    prior period

Goal 2: Tacting
  Baseline: 3 tacts | 3-month: 4 tacts | Current: 3 tacts
  Status:   REGRESSION — lost tact "car"; retained ball, cup, bubbles

Goal 3: Listener Responding
  Baseline: 5 instructions/60% | 3-month: 4/55% | Current: 3/50%
  Status:   CONTINUED REGRESSION

Goal 4: Motor Imitation
  Baseline: 6 actions/70% | 3-month: 5/65% | Current: 3/50%
  Status:   SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION — see detailed note below

Goal 5: Adaptive Skills
  Current status: Hand washing now requires full physical prompting
  throughout sequence. Buttoning: Eli can NO LONGER button independently —
  this skill was clearly present at intake and has been lost. Pincer grasp
  is notably weaker; Eli has difficulty picking up small items (beads,
  coins) that he previously manipulated without difficulty.
  Status:   SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                        31.5     29.0    22.5     -9.0

All domains show decline. Total VB-MAPP milestone score has decreased by
9.0 points (28.6% decline) over 6 months of intensive therapy.

IV. CRITICAL CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS

The following observations represent significant clinical concerns:

  1. LOSS OF FINE MOTOR SKILLS: Tasks mastered during month 2 of therapy
     (placing pegs in pegboard, stacking 5 blocks, turning pages of a book)
     are no longer performed. Eli's fine motor capabilities have declined
     measurably since intake. He now has difficulty with pincer grasp tasks
     that were within his repertoire at the start of services. Buttoning,
     which was independently performed at intake, now requires full physical
     assistance.

  2. GROSS MOTOR COORDINATION DECLINE: Gross motor coordination appears to
     have declined substantially. Eli now falls frequently during transitions
     between activities — an average of 3.2 falls per 3-hour session over
     the past month (compared to 0.8 falls per session during month 1).
     His gait has become more visibly unsteady, with increased lateral sway.
     He now requires hand-held assistance on the 3 steps leading to the
     outdoor play area, which he previously navigated independently.

  3. DISENGAGEMENT EPISODES — INCREASED FREQUENCY AND DURATION:
     Disengagement episodes have increased in both frequency and duration:

       Period         Avg per 3-hr session    Avg duration
       --------------------------------------------------------
       Month 1        4-6                     5-15 seconds
       Month 3        5-7                     8-15 seconds
       Month 6        8-10                    10-20 seconds

     Of significant concern: following these episodes, Eli now appears
     briefly confused and takes 30-60 seconds to re-engage with the
     therapeutic activity. During re-engagement, he often looks around the
     room as if unfamiliar with his surroundings. On two occasions this
     month, RBT Deshawn Carter observed what appeared to be subtle lip-
     smacking movements during an episode.

  4. PARENT REPORT: Mother (Denise Reeves) reports that Eli's nighttime
     sleep has become disrupted. He wakes 2-3 times per week appearing
     "terrified and confused," sometimes crying inconsolably for 10-15
     minutes. Mother also reports increased daytime staring episodes at
     home, consistent with what is observed in the clinic.

V. BCBA CLINICAL CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This assessor discussed clinical observations with supervisor Dr. Amy
Okonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D on 11/15/2016. The pattern of progressive skill
loss across all domains, combined with the changing character of the
disengagement episodes, is atypical for our ASD client population. In this
clinician's experience with over 40 ASD clients, loss of previously
acquired skills of this magnitude over a 6-month period is not consistent
with typical ASD behavioral variability or adjustment-related regression.

Additionally, the disengagement episodes we are observing share features
with absence seizures as described in clinical literature, including:
abrupt onset, unresponsiveness to stimuli, brief duration, and post-
episode confusion. The emerging lip-smacking automatism further raises
concern for seizure activity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Medical follow-up for possible seizure activity — recommend neurology
     referral and EEG evaluation
  2. Medical evaluation for underlying cause of progressive skill regression
  3. Continue ABA services pending medical evaluation
  4. Formal letter to be sent to pediatrician (Dr. Patricia Huang)
     documenting clinical concerns

RE:    Eli Reeves (DOB: 03/15/2012)
       Client ID: BBH-2016-0847

Dear Dr. Huang,

We are writing regarding our client Eli Reeves, whom we have been providing
intensive Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy since May 23, 2016. Eli was
referred to our center with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2,
and has been receiving 25 hours per week of ABA services under the supervision
of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

We wish to bring to your attention a pattern of clinical observations that we
believe warrants medical evaluation.

SKILL REGRESSION

Over the course of 6 months of intensive ABA therapy, Eli has demonstrated a
clear and measurable pattern of skill regression across all developmental
domains assessed by the VB-MAPP. His total milestone score has declined from
31.5 at intake to 22.5 at his most recent assessment — a 28.6% decrease. This
pattern is atypical for our ASD client population. In our clinical experience,
clients receiving intensive ABA services either make progress or plateau; a
sustained, multi-domain regression of this magnitude is unusual and, in our
professional opinion, is not adequately explained by motivational factors,
environmental change, or behavioral variability.

Specific areas of regression include:
  - Fine motor: Loss of independent buttoning (present at intake, now absent).
    Decline in pincer grasp strength and accuracy.
  - Gross motor: Increased frequency of falls (0.8/session at intake to
    3.2/session currently). Requires hand-held assistance on stairs that were
    previously navigated independently. Gait has become more unsteady.
  - Communication: Decrease in vocal mand repertoire (4 mands at 3-month
    review, now 2 vocal mands). No new tacts acquired.
  - Cognitive: Loss of color matching (4 colors to 2), loss of body part
    identification (5 to 3).

DISENGAGEMENT EPISODES

We have observed recurrent episodes of apparent disengagement that have
increased in frequency and duration over the course of treatment:

  - Intake (May 2016): 4-6 episodes per 3-hour session, lasting 5-15 seconds
  - Current (November 2016): 8-10 episodes per 3-hour session, lasting
    10-20 seconds

During these episodes, Eli ceases all motor activity, appears to stare
blankly (sometimes with slight upward gaze deviation), and is unresponsive
to his name, clapping, or light touch. Following each episode, he appears
disoriented for 30-60 seconds before resuming activity. On two recent
occasions, subtle lip-smacking movements were observed during the episodes.

These episodes share features with absence seizures as described in clinical
literature. While we recognize that inattention and "tuning out" can occur in
autism spectrum disorder, the clinical presentation — including the abrupt
onset, complete unresponsiveness, post-episode confusion, increasing frequency,
and emerging oral automatisms — is, in our assessment, not consistent with
simple behavioral inattention.

RECOMMENDATIONS

We respectfully recommend the following:
  1. Neurological evaluation, including EEG, to rule out seizure disorder
  2. Medical evaluation for potential underlying causes of progressive
     developmental regression
  3. We are happy to provide any additional behavioral data or clinical
     observations that may be helpful in your evaluation

We appreciate your attention to these concerns and are available to discuss
our observations at your convenience.

Respectfully,

RECORD 3.5 — TWELVE-MONTH PROGRESS REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF REPORT:     05/22/2017
REPORTING PERIOD:   11/21/2016 – 05/19/2017
CLIENT AGE:         5 years, 2 months
SERVICE HOURS:      Authorized: 25 hrs/week | Delivered: 21.8 hrs/week average
                    (reduced due to medical appointments and illness)
TOTAL SESSIONS:     52 sessions this period (cumulative: 166 sessions)
BCBA SUPERVISION:   Monthly + additional consultation sessions (6 sessions
                    direct, 14 hours total this period)

I. SUMMARY

This report documents continued and accelerating decline across all
developmental domains. Eli has now received 12 months of intensive ABA
therapy (approximately 560 total service hours). Despite modifications to
programming, reinforcement strategies, instructional methods (transition
from DTT-heavy to NET-heavy programming, introduction of PECS communication
system, environmental modifications per OT consultation), no treatment goals
have been met and all VB-MAPP domain scores have continued to decline.

II. GOAL PROGRESS

All original goals have been revised downward twice during the reporting
period due to ongoing regression. Current status of revised goals:

Goal 1 (revised): Eli will mand for 5 preferred items using any modality
  (vocal, sign, or PECS) across 2 consecutive sessions.
  Current: 2 vocal mands ("mama," "no"); PECS use inconsistent (exchanges
  picture for preferred item in 40% of opportunities, down from 60% when
  PECS was introduced in month 8). Sign "more" no longer used.
  Status: NOT MET — CONTINUED REGRESSION

Goal 2 (revised): Eli will tact 5 common items using any modality.
  Current: 1 consistent tact ("ball" — vocal). "Cup" and "bubbles"
  no longer produced.
  Status: NOT MET — CONTINUED REGRESSION

Goal 3 (revised): Eli will follow 5 one-step instructions with 60%
  accuracy.
  Current: Follows 2 instructions ("come here," "sit down") with
  approximately 45% accuracy.
  Status: NOT MET — CONTINUED REGRESSION

Goal 4 (revised): Eli will imitate 5 gross motor actions.
  Current: Imitates 1 action (clapping) with 40% accuracy. Previously
  imitated actions (stomping, raising arms, waving) are no longer
  performed.
  Status: NOT MET — SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION

Goal 5 (revised): Eli will participate in 2 self-care routines with
  no more than 3 prompts per step.
  Current: Requires full physical prompting for all self-care tasks.

of 19.5 points (61.9% decline) over 12 months of intensive ABA therapy.

IV. CRITICAL CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS

  1. FINE MOTOR: Eli demonstrates a clear pattern of progressive fine motor
     skill loss that is not consistent with typical ASD behavioral
     trajectories. He can no longer button independently (skill present at
     intake). Difficulty with pincer grasp tasks has worsened — he now uses
     a raking grasp for small objects and frequently drops items. He can no
     longer place pegs in a pegboard (mastered during month 2 of therapy).
     Writing/drawing: at intake, Eli could produce a crude circular scribble;
     he now makes only brief, irregular marks and frequently loses grip on
     the crayon.

  2. GROSS MOTOR: Gait has become significantly more ataxic over the past
     6 months. Eli now walks with a wide base and notable lateral instability.
     He requires hand-held assistance on stairs (previously independent
     with railing). Falls have increased to an average of 4.8 per 3-hour
     session. Running is no longer observed — Eli was able to run (clumsily
     but independently) at intake; he now does not attempt to run. He
     requires assistance transitioning from floor to standing.

  3. DISENGAGEMENT EPISODES — CONTINUED ESCALATION:

       Period              Avg per 3-hr session    Avg duration
       -------------------------------------------------------
       Intake (05/16)      4-6                     5-15 seconds
       3-month (08/16)     5-7                     8-15 seconds
       6-month (11/16)     8-10                    10-20 seconds
       12-month (05/17)    12-15                   10-25 seconds

     Episodes are now sometimes accompanied by subtle bilateral eye
     fluttering lasting 2-5 seconds. Post-episode confusion has become
     more pronounced — Eli now takes 1-2 minutes to re-engage following
     longer episodes. On 3 occasions during this period, Eli slumped
     slightly in his chair during an episode, suggesting possible brief
     loss of postural tone.

  4. PARENT REPORT: Mother reports continued nighttime wakings (now 4-5
     times per week). Eli is "harder to wake up in the morning" and has
     decreased appetite. Mother reports that family members who had not
     seen Eli for several months were "shocked" by his decline. Maternal
     grandmother stated: "Something is wrong — this isn't just autism."

V. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Client demonstrates a clear pattern of skill loss that is not consistent
with typical ASD behavioral trajectories. Over 12 months of intensive ABA
services (approximately 560 hours), Eli has not acquired any new skills and
has lost the majority of skills present at intake. This degree of regression
cannot be attributed to motivational factors, demand avoidance, environmental
adjustment, or typical ASD behavioral variability.

This clinician reiterates and strengthens the recommendation made in our
letter to Dr. Huang dated December 2, 2016: Eli requires comprehensive
medical and neurological evaluation. The progressive nature of the skill
loss across motor, communicative, and cognitive domains, combined with the
escalating disengagement episodes (which this clinician believes are
consistent with seizure activity), suggests an underlying medical condition
that may be separate from or in place of the ASD diagnosis.

We strongly recommend:
  1. Urgent neurology referral with EEG
  2. Comprehensive medical workup for causes of progressive developmental
     regression
  3. Consideration of metabolic, genetic, or neurodegenerative etiologies

DATE OF DISCHARGE:   07/15/2017
CLIENT AGE:          5 years, 4 months (corrected: 5 years, 4 months)
TOTAL LENGTH OF
  SERVICE:           14 months (05/23/2016 – 07/15/2017)
TOTAL SERVICE HOURS: Approximately 672 hours of direct ABA therapy
REASON FOR
  DISCHARGE:         Parent-initiated. Family electing to discontinue ABA
                     services to focus on medical evaluation and treatment.

I. DISCHARGE SUMMARY

Eli Reeves received 14 months of intensive ABA therapy (25 hours/week
authorized) at Buckeye Behavioral Health. Services were provided by RBT
Deshawn Carter under the supervision of BCBA Jennifer Mallory, M.Ed., with
clinical oversight by Dr. Amy Okonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D.

II. TREATMENT OUTCOMES

Client did not achieve any VB-MAPP milestones during 14 months of intensive
ABA therapy. A progressive decline in previously acquired skills was observed
across all developmental domains:

                              Intake Score    Discharge Score    Change

Motor Imitation                 4.0             0.5              -3.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Total VB-MAPP decline: 68.3% over 14 months.

III. CLINICAL STATEMENT

This pattern of sustained, progressive, multi-domain skill regression over
14 months of intensive behavioral intervention is inconsistent with the
expected trajectory for ABA therapy in autism spectrum disorder. In the
clinical experience of this BCBA (8 years, >40 ASD clients) and the
supervising BCBA-D (15 years, >150 ASD clients), we have not observed a
pattern of this nature in a client whose primary diagnosis is ASD.

Clients with ASD receiving intensive ABA therapy typically demonstrate either
measurable skill acquisition or plateau. Sustained regression of this
magnitude — particularly the progressive loss of motor skills (fine and
gross), the escalating disengagement episodes with seizure-like features,
and the decline in cognitive/perceptual skills — warrants comprehensive
medical and neurological evaluation to identify a possible underlying
neurodegenerative, metabolic, or genetic condition.

IV. REFERRAL AND COORDINATION

  - Letter sent to Dr. Patricia Huang (pediatrician) on 12/02/2016
    documenting concerns — copy in chart
  - Verbal communication with Dr. Huang's office on 01/15/2017 and
    04/10/2017 reiterating concerns
  - Neurology referral reported by parent to be pending
  - Complete therapy records, data sheets, and VB-MAPP assessments
    released to parent (Denise Reeves) upon signed authorization

V. DISCHARGE RECOMMENDATIONS

  1. Comprehensive neurological evaluation including EEG
  2. Medical workup for progressive developmental regression
  3. Continued speech-language and occupational therapy services to
     maintain current skill levels
  4. If medical evaluation identifies a treatable condition and Eli
     stabilizes or improves, ABA services may be reconsidered
  5. Transition planning with school district for appropriate educational
     placement and supports

  4. Support school IEP process — records forwarded to Maple Grove
     Elementary per parent request
  5. Well-established diagnosis of ASD per developmental pediatrics
     evaluation at age 3.5. Will continue current therapeutic
     interventions and monitor developmental progress.
  6. Return for 5-year well-child visit in March 2017
  7. Return sooner if concerns arise, particularly regarding staring
     spells — if episodes become longer, more frequent, or involve any
     convulsive movements, call or present to ED

RECORD 4.2 — FIVE-YEAR WELL-CHILD VISIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF VISIT:      03/20/2017
PATIENT AGE:        5 years, 0 months
VISIT TYPE:         Well-Child / Preventive Visit (CPT: 99394)
PROVIDER:           Patricia Huang, MD

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 5-year well-child check.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Mother reports ongoing concerns regarding Eli's development. Per parent
report and ABA therapy progress notes (most recent report dated 11/21/2016
from Buckeye Behavioral Health, BCBA Jennifer Mallory), Eli has not made
expected progress in ABA therapy and has demonstrated regression in several
skill areas. Mother states: "He's going backwards. He used to be able to do
things he can't do anymore."

Specific regression concerns per parent:
  - Could dress himself with minimal help at age 4; now requires full
    assistance with buttons and zippers
  - Walking seems more unsteady — falls more often
  - Verbal output has decreased — uses fewer words than 6 months ago
  - Staring spells continue and have become "worse and more frequent"

Mother also reports significant sleep disturbance: Eli wakes 3-4 nights per
week appearing "terrified and confused." He cries inconsolably for 10-15
minutes after these episodes and does not seem to recognize his surroundings
initially. Episodes occur 1-3 hours after sleep onset. Mother denies
witnessing convulsive movements during these episodes but states she has
"not always been in the room when they start."

Also received letter from BCBA Jennifer Mallory (dated 12/02/2016)
expressing concern about progressive skill regression and recommending
neurological evaluation for possible seizure activity. [Copy scanned
to chart.]

DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING:
  - ASQ-3 (60-month): Communication 10 (below cutoff), Gross Motor 20
    (monitoring zone), Fine Motor 15 (below cutoff), Problem Solving 15
    (below cutoff), Personal-Social 10 (below cutoff)
  - Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT): not applicable
    (age >4 years; prior ASD diagnosis established)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Vitals:
    Height: 42.5 inches (30th percentile) [down from 45th percentile
      at age 4 years 2 months]
    Weight: 38.0 lbs (25th percentile) [down from 35th percentile]
    BMI: 14.8 (35th percentile)
    HR: 92 bpm
    RR: 20
    BP: 92/58 mmHg
    Temp: 98.2 F

  General: Thin-appearing biracial male. Quiet, minimally interactive.
    No acute distress.
  HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. PERRL. TMs clear. Oropharynx clear.
    Vision screening attempted — unable to cooperate with Snellen chart;
    fixates and follows briefly.
  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
  Chest/Lungs: Clear bilaterally.
  CV: RRR, no murmur.
  Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No hepatosplenomegaly.
  MSK: Toe-walking continues. Gait appears more unsteady than at
    transfer visit — wider base, some lateral sway. Fell once during
    exam (tripped transitioning from exam table to floor with step stool
    assistance).
  Neurological (screening):
    - Hand-wringing stereotypy continues — appears more frequent than
      prior visit
    - Verbal output: 1 word heard during visit ("mama")
    - Did not follow any verbal commands during exam
    - Hypotonia continues — generalized, mild-moderate
    - Reflexes: 2+ symmetric

  During the examination, one staring episode was witnessed by this
  provider. Duration approximately 10 seconds. Eli ceased movement, stared
  ahead with slight upward gaze, and was unresponsive to name or clapping.
  Resumed activity after approximately 10 seconds, appeared briefly
  confused. No convulsive movements noted.

ASSESSMENT:
  1. Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2 (F84.0)
  2. Developmental regression — noted by ABA therapy center and confirmed
     by parent report and clinical observation. Multiple domains affected
     (motor, communication, adaptive).
  3. Staring spells — witnessed in clinic today. Likely absence-type
     episodes which can co-occur with ASD.
  4. Sleep disturbance with nocturnal wakings (G47.9)
  5. Toe-walking, bilateral (R26.0)
  6. Growth: height and weight percentiles have declined since transfer
     visit. Height 45th to 30th, weight 35th to 25th.

PLAN:
  1. History and exam consistent with ASD with moderate intellectual
     disability. Some skill regression can occur in autism, particularly
     during periods of stress and transition. Family has undergone
     significant change with interstate move.
  2. Staring spells noted — likely absence-type episodes which can
     co-occur with ASD. Consider neurology referral if episodes increase
     in frequency or duration, or if any convulsive movements are observed.
  3. Sleep disturbance: discussed sleep hygiene measures. Melatonin
     0.5 mg at bedtime may be trialed. If nocturnal episodes continue
     with features concerning for seizures, will refer to neurology.
  4. Growth deceleration: likely related to decreased appetite per parent
     report. Will monitor. Ensure adequate caloric intake. Consider
     nutritional supplementation (PediaSure or equivalent).
  5. Continue ABA therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy.
  6. BCBA concerns regarding regression acknowledged. Will monitor closely
     at next visit. Neurology referral will be placed if regression
     continues or staring spells worsen.
  7. Immunizations: DTaP #5, IPV #4, MMR #2, Varicella #2 administered
     today.
  8. Return in 6 months for progress check, or sooner if concerns arise.

RECORD 4.3 — SICK VISIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF VISIT:      07/14/2017
PATIENT AGE:        5 years, 4 months
VISIT TYPE:         Sick Visit (CPT: 99213)
PROVIDER:           Patricia Huang, MD

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Cough and runny nose x 3 days.

HPI: Mother brings Eli for cough and nasal congestion of 3 days' duration.
Low-grade fever (100.2 F at home yesterday). No vomiting, no diarrhea.
Decreased appetite (though appetite has been generally poor per recent visits).
Drinking adequate fluids per mom.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Vitals:
    Temp: 99.8 F (oral)
    HR: 104 bpm
    RR: 24
    SpO2: 98% RA
    Weight: 38.4 lbs

  General: Mild rhinorrhea. Quiet, non-interactive. No acute respiratory
    distress.
  HEENT: Mild nasal congestion with clear rhinorrhea. TMs: mild erythema
    bilaterally without bulging or effusion. Oropharynx: mild erythema
    posteriorly, no exudate. No tonsillar enlargement.
  Neck: Supple, small bilateral anterior cervical lymph nodes, mobile,
    non-tender.
  Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles.
  CV: Tachycardic (consistent with low-grade fever). Regular rhythm,
    no murmur.
  Abdomen: Soft, non-tender.

ASSESSMENT:
  1. Acute upper respiratory infection, viral (J06.9)
  2. ASD (F84.0) — ongoing

PLAN:
  1. Supportive care: fluids, rest, acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever/
     discomfort per weight-based dosing.
  2. Return if fever >102 F, difficulty breathing, or symptoms worsen.

ADDENDUM — ADDITIONAL PARENT CONCERNS (documented at visit):

During the sick visit, mother raised additional developmental concerns.
Mom asks about the staring spells again. She reports they are now "much
worse — sometimes 20-30 seconds and he seems confused after, like he
doesn't know where he is." She states the episodes occur 5-8 times per
day, an increase from what she previously reported.

Mother also reports that the nighttime wakings have become more frequent
and more intense. Eli wakes 4-5 nights per week, "screaming and thrashing,"
and appears frightened and disoriented. He does not recognize his mother
for the first several minutes. Mother states: "I've been reading online
and these look like seizures to me. I need someone to take this seriously."

Mother also reports that Eli's ABA therapist (BCBA Jennifer Mallory) has
been "begging us to get him to a neurologist" and that the ABA center is
recommending discharge due to lack of progress.

ADDENDUM PLAN:
  3. Neurology referral placed today to Ohio Neurology Associates for
     evaluation of staring spells, possible absence seizures, and
     developmental regression. Referral marked as URGENT. Current
     estimated wait time for new patient neurology appointments is
     approximately 3-4 months per scheduling.
  4. Advised mother: if any episode involves convulsive movements (shaking,
     stiffening, rhythmic jerking) or lasts longer than 2 minutes, call
     911 or proceed to nearest emergency department.
  5. Acknowledged mother's concerns regarding the staring spells and
     nighttime episodes. Agreed that neurological evaluation is warranted.

PATIENT AGE:        5 years, 6 months
ENCOUNTER TYPE:     Telephone — incoming call from parent
PROVIDER:           Patricia Huang, MD (returned call)
CALL DURATION:      12 minutes

DOCUMENTATION OF CALL:

Mother (Denise Reeves) called regarding two issues:

1. BCBA LETTER: Mother received a copy of a follow-up letter from BCBA
   Jennifer Mallory at Buckeye Behavioral Health (discharge summary dated
   07/15/2017) reiterating recommendation for urgent neurological evaluation.
   Mother wants to confirm that a neurology referral has been placed.

   Response: Confirmed that neurology referral was placed on 07/14/2017
   to Ohio Neurology Associates, marked as urgent. Per scheduling, the
   earliest available new patient appointment with Dr. Robert Chen is
   04/10/2018 — approximately 6 months from now. This is the current
   wait time for new neurology patients.

   UPDATE: After discussion, called Ohio Neurology Associates scheduling
   to request earlier appointment given clinical urgency. Was informed
   that a cancellation slot may open sooner and mother has been placed
   on the cancellation list. Office will call mother directly if an
   earlier appointment becomes available.

2. SEIZURE CONCERN: Mother reports that last night Eli had an episode
   during which he stopped moving, stared blankly for approximately
   25 seconds, and then "his arms twitched a couple of times" before he
   "came back." This is the first time mother has observed any motor
   component beyond eye fluttering. She is frightened and wants to know
   if she should go to the ER.

   Response: Discussed the episode in detail. The twitching was brief
   (2-3 seconds per mother), self-limited, and Eli returned to baseline
   (albeit confused) within 1-2 minutes. This does not constitute a
   medical emergency but does add to the clinical urgency of the
   neurology evaluation.

   Advised: If any episode involves sustained convulsive movements (>30
   seconds of rhythmic shaking), loss of consciousness with fall, or
   failure to return to baseline within 5 minutes, call 911 or go to ER
   immediately.

   Mom expresses frustration: "Six months to see a neurologist? He's
   getting worse every week. I've been asking about this for over a year.
   The ABA people told you something was wrong. When is someone going
   to help my son?"

   Acknowledged mother's frustration and concern. Emphasized that the
   referral is in place and efforts are being made to expedite. Offered
   to explore alternative neurology providers or university medical center
   options. Mother agreed to consider Nationwide Children's Hospital
   neurology as alternative referral.

PLAN:
  - Referral placed to Nationwide Children's Hospital Pediatric Neurology
    as additional/alternative referral (may have shorter wait time)
  - Mother to call if any prolonged seizure activity per above instructions
  - Follow-up at next scheduled visit or sooner if needed

RECORD 4.5 — SIX-YEAR WELL-CHILD VISIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF VISIT:      03/19/2018
PATIENT AGE:        6 years, 0 months
VISIT TYPE:         Well-Child / Preventive Visit (CPT: 99394)
PROVIDER:           Patricia Huang, MD

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 6-year well-child check.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Eli was last seen for a well-child visit on 03/20/2017 (one year ago) and
for a sick visit on 07/14/2017.

Mother reports significant ongoing concerns:

  - DEVELOPMENTAL REGRESSION: Mother states that Eli's abilities have
    continued to decline significantly over the past year. Per parent report,
    Eli could dress himself with assistance at age 4. He now requires full
    assistance with all dressing tasks. He cannot button or zip. He can no
    longer put on his own shoes (previously could with help).
  - MOTOR: Walking is notably more unsteady. Falls 2-3 times daily. Has
    difficulty with stairs and requires hand-held assistance or railing.
    He no longer runs. He trips over his own feet on flat surfaces.
  - COMMUNICATION: Verbal output has decreased. Mother estimates he uses
    approximately 5-8 single words (down from ~15-20 words at age 3-4).
    He does not combine words.
  - STARING EPISODES: Continue to occur multiple times daily (estimated
    5-8 per day by parent). Duration typically 15-30 seconds. Post-episode
    confusion lasting 1-2 minutes. Mother has observed occasional arm
    twitching (2-3 seconds) during some episodes.
  - SLEEP: Nighttime wakings continue 4-5 nights per week.
  - NUTRITION: Appetite remains poor. Mother has been supplementing with
    PediaSure per prior recommendation.
  - ABA: Discontinued in July 2017 due to lack of progress. Eli continues
    to receive school-based speech and OT services.
  - NEUROLOGY: Appointment with Dr. Robert Chen scheduled for 04/10/2018
    (next month) via Ohio Neurology Associates. Nationwide Children's
    referral was placed but family was informed of a 5-month wait;
    Dr. Chen appointment came first via cancellation list.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

    Trend: Progressive decline in growth percentiles across both
    height and weight over 2-year observation period.

  General: Thin-appearing biracial male. Quiet, appears withdrawn.
    No acute distress. Appears somewhat less alert/engaged than at
    prior visits.
  HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. PERRL. TMs clear bilaterally.
    Oropharynx clear. Dental: no caries visible, mild crowding.
    Vision: unable to cooperate with standard screening.

  Chest/Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
  CV: RRR, no murmur.
  Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No organomegaly.
  MSK/Extremities: Increased tone noted in bilateral lower extremities
    (new finding — previously documented as hypotonic). Mild bilateral
    ankle equinus contracture developing. Toe-walking is now near-
    constant (>90% of ambulation). Range of motion at ankles reduced
    (dorsiflexion limited to neutral bilaterally, previously 10-15
    degrees past neutral).
  Spine: No visible scoliosis on forward bend test at this time.
  Neurological (screening):
    - Hand-wringing stereotypy: persistent, near-continuous during visit
    - Gait: markedly wide-based, lateral sway, unsteady. Required
      mother's hand for ambulation in hallway. Toe-walking near-constant.
    - Fell once during visit (stumbled on flat floor transitioning
      between rooms)
    - Verbal output: 2 single words during 30-minute visit ("mama," "no")
    - Did not follow any verbal commands
    - Fine motor: attempted crayon grasp — used crude fist grasp, could
      not hold crayon steadily, made one brief mark on paper
    - Tone: lower extremities now mildly increased (spasticity developing);
      upper extremities remain hypotonic
    - DTRs: 2+ bilateral upper, now 3+ bilateral lower (brisk — new
      finding, previously 2+)
    - No clonus elicited
    - One staring episode witnessed during visit: approximately 15 seconds,
      unresponsive, subtle eye fluttering noted, post-episode confusion
      approximately 90 seconds

LABORATORY RESULTS (ordered today):
  1. Blood Lead Level: 1.2 mcg/dL (reference: <3.5 mcg/dL) — NORMAL
  2. CBC with Differential:
       WBC: 7.2 x10^3/uL (normal: 5.0-14.5)
       RBC: 4.65 x10^6/uL (normal: 4.0-5.2)
       Hemoglobin: 12.8 g/dL (normal: 11.5-13.5)
       Hematocrit: 38.2% (normal: 34-40)
       MCV: 82 fL (normal: 75-87)
       Platelets: 268 x10^3/uL (normal: 150-400)
       Differential: within normal limits
     Result: NORMAL — no anemia, no cytopenias, no concerning findings

ASSESSMENT:
  1. Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) — with significant developmental
     regression across multiple domains (motor, communication, cognitive,
     adaptive) over a 2-year observed period
  2. Staring episodes — increasing in frequency and duration, now with
     occasional motor component (arm twitching, eye fluttering). Possible
     absence seizures. Episode witnessed in clinic today.
  3. Gait disturbance with progressive instability (R26.2) — markedly
     worsened since last well-child visit
  4. Bilateral ankle equinus contracture developing (M24.579) — likely
     related to persistent toe-walking and emerging spasticity
  5. Growth percentile decline — height and weight trending down over
     2 years (height 45th to 25th; weight 35th to 20th)
  6. Blood lead: normal
  7. CBC: normal

PLAN:
  1. ASD with concerning developmental regression. Neurology evaluation
     pending — appointment with Dr. Robert Chen on 04/10/2018 (next month).
     Will defer further neurological workup to neurology.
  2. Staring episodes: to be evaluated by neurology. Mother instructed to
     keep a log of episodes (frequency, duration, any motor features,
     post-episode behavior) to bring to neurology appointment.
  3. Orthopedic referral placed for evaluation of bilateral ankle
     equinus contracture and gait disturbance. Will need assessment for
     ankle-foot orthotics (AFOs) and physical therapy.
  4. Growth: continue PediaSure supplementation. Monitor at next visit.
     Consider nutritional consultation if decline continues.
  5. Blood lead and CBC: normal. No further labs at this time — will defer
     additional workup to neurology.
  6. School: IEP in place at Maple Grove Elementary. Mother reports annual
     review is upcoming. Will provide medical documentation to support
     accommodations.
  7. Follow-up: after neurology appointment to review findings and plan.

RECORD 4.6 — POST-NEUROLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF VISIT:      06/18/2018
PATIENT AGE:        6 years, 3 months
VISIT TYPE:         Follow-Up Visit (CPT: 99214)
PROVIDER:           Patricia Huang, MD

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up after neurology evaluation and MRI.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Eli was seen by Dr. Robert Chen at Ohio Neurology Associates on 04/10/2018
for evaluation of developmental regression and staring episodes. Per
consultation note received 04/25/2018:

  - Neurological examination performed
  - MRI brain without and with contrast obtained 04/24/2018
  - MRI result: "Mildly prominent ventricles, likely developmental variant.
    No acute intracranial pathology."
  - Dr. Chen's assessment: staring spells most likely behavioral in nature
    given absence of structural pathology and known ASD diagnosis
  - Recommendation: continued monitoring; re-refer for EEG if episodes
    increase or any convulsive activity is observed

Mother reports she is "somewhat relieved" by the normal MRI but continues
to have concerns: "The MRI being normal doesn't explain why he's losing
skills." Mother reports staring episodes continue at the same frequency
(5-8/day) and that Eli's walking has continued to worsen — he fell down
3 steps at home last week (not injured).

Mother also reports that Eli has started to have difficulty swallowing
certain foods (coughing with thin liquids approximately once per meal).
This is a new concern.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Vitals:
    Weight: 42.6 lbs (18th percentile)
    HR: 90 bpm
    Temp: 98.4 F

  General: Thin. Quiet. Minimal interaction.
  Neurological: Gait more unsteady than March visit. Near-continuous
    hand-wringing. Minimal verbal output. Lower extremity tone increased
    compared to March — mild spasticity bilateral.

ASSESSMENT:
  1. ASD with developmental regression (F84.0)
  2. Staring episodes — per neurology, likely behavioral (no structural
     pathology on MRI)
  3. MRI brain: mildly prominent ventricles, likely normal variant
  4. Emerging dysphagia — new concern
  5. Gait instability — progressive

PLAN:
  1. Neurology evaluation reassuring regarding no acute structural pathology
     on MRI. Continue current supports. Regression may be related to ASD
     behavioral patterns or anxiety. Will monitor.
  2. New swallowing concern: referral placed for swallowing evaluation
     (modified barium swallow study) through speech-language pathology.
     In the interim, mother advised to thicken liquids if coughing
     continues, cut foods into small pieces, supervise all meals.
  3. Orthopedic referral pending — mother to follow up on scheduling.
  4. Continue monitoring staring episodes per neurology recommendations.
     Re-refer to neurology if convulsive activity or significant worsening.
  5. Follow-up in 3 months or sooner if concerns.

RECORD 4.7 — SEVEN-YEAR WELL-CHILD VISIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE OF VISIT:      03/18/2019
PATIENT AGE:        7 years, 0 months
VISIT TYPE:         Well-Child / Preventive Visit (CPT: 99394)
PROVIDER:           Patricia Huang, MD

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 7-year well-child check.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Significant changes since last well-child visit (03/19/2018):

  MOTOR: Progressive decline. Eli now requires ankle-foot orthotics
  (AFOs), fitted 09/2018 by orthopedics. Even with AFOs, gait remains
  very unsteady. He can walk short distances (50-100 feet) with a walker
  or hand-held assistance but fatigues quickly. Orthopedics has diagnosed
  mild thoracolumbar scoliosis (Cobb angle 12 degrees, 10/2018 X-ray) and
  is monitoring.

  COMMUNICATION: Speech has decreased to mostly single words. Mother
  estimates Eli now uses 3-5 words ("mama," "dada," "no," "help," and
  sometimes "more"). He previously used 15-20 words at age 3-4 and
  approximately 5-8 words at age 6. He does not combine words.

  STARING EPISODES: Continue 2-3 times daily per parent. Duration
  typically 15-30 seconds with post-episode confusion. Mother has
  continued to observe occasional arm twitching. Mother states: "I know
  these are seizures. I've watched every video online. These are seizures."

  SWALLOWING: Modified barium swallow study (08/2018) revealed mild
  oropharyngeal dysphagia with delayed swallow initiation and trace
  penetration with thin liquids. SLP recommended thickened liquids
  (nectar consistency) and soft/chopped foods. Family is following
  recommendations.

  SLEEP: Nocturnal episodes continue but have decreased slightly in
  frequency (2-3 nights per week, down from 4-5). Mother attributes
  this to melatonin (now 1 mg at bedtime).

  SCHOOL: Per IEP annual review (01/2019), Eli has not met any IEP goals
  and has continued to lose previously mastered skills. School is
  recommending a change in placement from inclusion classroom with 1:1
  aide to a self-contained special education classroom.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Vitals:
    Height: 46.5 inches (20th percentile) [continued decline: 45th at
      4y2m, 30th at 5y, 25th at 6y, now 20th]
    Weight: 44.0 lbs (15th percentile) [continued decline: 35th at
      4y2m, 25th at 5y, 20th at 6y, now 15th]
    BMI: 14.3 (15th percentile)

    7y0m    20th           15th           15th
    Trend: Sustained progressive decline across all growth parameters.

  General: Thin male, appears younger than stated age. Wearing bilateral
    AFOs. Quiet, minimally responsive to examiner. No acute distress.
  HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. PERRL. TMs clear. Oropharynx clear.
    Mild drooling noted (new finding). Vision screening: unable to
    cooperate. Hearing: unable to cooperate with audiometry — recommend
    formal audiology evaluation.
  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
  Chest/Lungs: Clear bilaterally.
  CV: RRR, no murmur.
  Abdomen: Soft, non-tender. No organomegaly.
  MSK/Extremities: Bilateral AFOs in place. Without AFOs: bilateral ankle
    equinus contracture (dorsiflexion limited to 5 degrees plantarflexion
    bilaterally — worsened). Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis visible on
    forward bend. Hips: full range of motion, no click.
  Spine: Mild asymmetry on forward bend, consistent with known scoliosis.
  Neurological:
    - Alertness: awake but appears less alert than prior visits. Response
      to stimuli is delayed.
    - Hand-wringing: near-continuous, present throughout entire visit
    - Gait: with AFOs and mother's hand, walks with wide base, significant
      lateral instability, shuffling steps. Without support, takes 2-3
      steps before losing balance.
    - Fine motor: unable to grasp crayon. Unable to pick up small objects
      (cheerios on table — used raking motion, unsuccessful). Could not
      stack any blocks (could stack 4 at age 4y2m per ABA intake).
    - Verbal output: 1 word heard during 30-minute visit ("mama")
    - Tone: upper extremities — moderate hypotonia; lower extremities —
      moderate spasticity (increased from mild at age 6)
    - DTRs: upper 2+, lower 3+ with bilateral ankle clonus (3 beats
      bilaterally — new finding)
    - One staring episode witnessed during visit: approximately 20 seconds,
      subtle eye fluttering, brief bilateral upper extremity twitch at
      conclusion, post-episode confusion approximately 2 minutes

                                                 cognitive tasks.

ASSESSMENT:
  1. Autism Spectrum Disorder — revising to Level 3: Requiring Very
     Substantial Support (F84.0) — based on current functional level
     requiring maximum support in all domains
  2. Epilepsy — possible absence seizures (G40.A09) — staring episodes
     with eye fluttering and occasional motor component, witnessed in
     clinic, now occurring 2-3x/day per parent. Episode today had
     features highly suggestive of seizure (eye fluttering, terminal
     motor twitch, post-ictal confusion).
  3. Developmental regression of unclear etiology — progressive loss of
     motor, communication, cognitive, and adaptive skills documented over
     a 3-year period. The magnitude and progressive nature of this
     regression is atypical for ASD alone.
  4. Gait disturbance, progressive (R26.2) — now requiring AFOs and
     assistive device
  5. Scoliosis, thoracolumbar, mild (M41.20) — under orthopedic
     monitoring
  6. Oropharyngeal dysphagia (R13.12) — on thickened liquids
  7. Growth percentile decline — sustained over 3 years, all parameters
  8. Drooling (R68.2) — new finding, likely related to oromotor decline

PLAN:
  1. Orthopedic referral: ACTIVE — continue monitoring scoliosis and
     gait. Next orthopedic follow-up scheduled 05/2019.
  2. Neurology follow-up: strongly recommend repeat neurology evaluation
     given ongoing regression and increasingly convincing seizure
     presentation. The episode witnessed today had classic features of
     an absence seizure with motor component. Will re-refer to Dr. Chen
     with updated clinical information and request EEG.
  3. Consider repeat neurology evaluation given ongoing regression — the
     initial evaluation (04/2018) was 11 months ago and significant
     clinical decline has occurred since.
  4. Audiology referral — for formal hearing assessment (unable to
     cooperate with in-office screening)
  5. Continue SLP with dysphagia management
  6. Continue OT through school
  7. Melatonin: continue 1 mg at bedtime
  8. Nutrition: continue dietary supplementation. Weight 15th percentile
     is concerning. Monitor closely.
  9. School: support IEP team recommendations for self-contained
     placement. Will provide medical documentation.
  10. Return in 6 months or sooner. Mother may call with any acute
      concerns.

SUBJECT: Incident Report — Eli Reeves (DOB: 03/15/2012, Grade: 1st)

Dear Dr. Huang,

I am writing to inform you of an incident that occurred today during
Eli Reeves' first-grade classroom session.

At approximately 10:15 AM, Eli's 1:1 aide (Ms. Thompson) reported that
Eli suddenly stopped responding during a tabletop activity. Per the aide's
report and my own observation upon arrival to the classroom (approximately
2 minutes after onset):

  - Eli was seated in his adapted chair at his desk
  - He stopped all movement and became completely unresponsive
  - His eyes appeared to flutter rapidly for approximately 10-15 seconds
  - The episode lasted approximately 30 seconds total
  - When he "came back," he did not appear to know where he was for
    about one minute — he looked around the room with a confused
    expression and did not respond to his name or to Ms. Thompson
  - He then began to cry quietly for approximately 2 minutes
  - After approximately 3-4 minutes total, he returned to his baseline
    level of alertness and engagement
  - No convulsive movements were observed
  - He did not fall from his chair
  - His color remained normal throughout

This is the third such episode observed at school this month. Previous
episodes occurred on 11/05/2018 and 11/09/2018, each lasting approximately
15-25 seconds with similar features. Staff are concerned that these may
be seizures.

We have documented these episodes in Eli's school health file. His IEP
team has been notified.

We are requesting medical guidance regarding:
  1. Whether these episodes are seizures
  2. What school staff should do when an episode occurs
  3. Whether a seizure action plan should be developed for school
  4. Whether any medication changes or evaluations are pending

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Karen Delgado, RN, BSN
School Nurse, Maple Grove Elementary

DR. HUANG'S RESPONSE (faxed 11/19/2018):

Dear Ms. Delgado,

Thank you for your detailed report regarding Eli Reeves. Your observations
are consistent with the episodes his mother has been reporting and that
I have witnessed in the office.

Eli has a history of these staring/unresponsive episodes. He was evaluated
by a neurologist (Dr. Robert Chen, Ohio Neurology Associates) in April
2018. An MRI of the brain was performed and did not show acute pathology.
The neurologist assessed the episodes as likely behavioral in nature in
the context of his autism diagnosis.

However, given the increasing frequency and the features you describe
(eye fluttering, post-episode confusion, crying), I share your concern
that these may represent seizure activity. I will recommend follow-up
with the neurologist regarding the increased frequency of episodes and
will request EEG evaluation.

In the meantime, please implement the following school seizure
precautions:
  1. If an episode occurs, ensure Eli is in a safe position (seated or
     supported). Do not restrain him.
  2. Time the episode from onset to resolution.
  3. Note any motor features (eye fluttering, twitching, stiffening).
  4. Note duration of post-episode confusion.
  5. Document and report to parent and this office.
  6. If any episode involves convulsive movements lasting >2 minutes,
     loss of consciousness with fall, or failure to return to baseline
     within 5 minutes — call 911.

I will work with the family to develop a formal seizure action plan
once neurology follow-up has occurred.

Thank you for your vigilance and thorough documentation.

Sincerely,
Patricia Huang, MD

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
"ASD with developmental regression and staring spells" — per referral from
Dr. Patricia Huang, MD.

REFERRAL INFORMATION:
Referral received from Dr. Patricia Huang, Columbus Children's Medical Group.
Referral letter dated 07/14/2017, with updated clinical note from 03/19/2018
faxed 03/22/2018. Records received include:
  - Dr. Huang's new patient note (06/08/2016)
  - Dr. Huang's 5-year well-child note (03/20/2017)
  - Dr. Huang's sick visit note (07/14/2017)
  - Dr. Huang's 6-year well-child note (03/19/2018)
  - BCBA letter from Buckeye Behavioral Health (12/02/2016)
  - CBC and blood lead results (03/2018)

NOTE: Records prior to 06/2016 were not available for review. Per
Dr. Huang's notes, the patient was diagnosed with ASD at age 3.5 years
in Virginia and had an MRI brain at age 3 that was reportedly normal. The
original diagnostic evaluation, MRI report, and Virginia medical records
were not included in the materials received by this office.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Eli Reeves is a 6-year, 1-month-old biracial male with a diagnosis of
Autism Spectrum Disorder (Level 2) who presents for neurological evaluation
of developmental regression and staring spells.

Per referral documentation and parent interview:

  History of ASD: Diagnosed at age 3.5 years by a developmental pediatrician
  in Virginia (Dr. Whitfield — records not available for review). Diagnosis
  was based on limited speech, repetitive hand movements, and social
  withdrawal. Per parent, MRI brain at age 3 was normal. Received ABA therapy
  for approximately 14 months in Columbus (ages 4-5.5 years) with no progress
  and apparent regression per ABA therapy reports.

  Developmental regression: Per parent report and Dr. Huang's documentation,
  Eli has demonstrated progressive loss of previously acquired skills over
  the past 2 years. Mother reports he could dress himself with assistance,
  button large buttons, use 15-20 words, and walk independently (though
  unsteadily) at age 4. He now requires full assistance with dressing,
  cannot button, uses approximately 5 single words, and walks only with
  AFOs and hand-held support.

  Staring spells: Per parent report, staring episodes have been present
  since at least age 3-4. Episodes have increased in frequency (now 5-8
  per day) and duration (now 15-30 seconds). During episodes, Eli ceases
  all activity, stares ahead (sometimes with upward gaze deviation), and
  is unresponsive to name or touch. Post-episode confusion lasts 1-2
  minutes. Mother has recently observed occasional brief arm twitching
  (2-3 seconds) at the end of some episodes. One episode was witnessed by
  Dr. Huang during the 03/2018 well-child visit.

  Nocturnal events: Eli wakes 3-5 nights per week appearing frightened and
  disoriented. Episodes typically occur 1-3 hours after sleep onset.
  Duration of confusion/distress: 10-20 minutes per mother. No witnessed
  convulsive movements during nocturnal events, though mother acknowledges
  she is not always present at onset.

  Mother's concerns: "Something else is going on besides autism. He is
  losing abilities. Autistic kids are supposed to get better with therapy,
  not worse. I think the staring spells are seizures."

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  - ASD Level 2 (diagnosed age 3.5, Virginia)
  - Late walking (26 months)
  - MRI brain age 3: reportedly normal (report not available)
  - No hospitalizations, no surgeries
  - NKDA
  - Medications: Melatonin 1 mg qhs

FAMILY HISTORY:
  - No known family history of epilepsy, seizure disorders, or
    neurodegenerative conditions
  - No consanguinity
  - No other family members with ASD or intellectual disability per parent

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  Neuro: As per HPI. Also — mother reports Eli is "harder to wake up"
    in the mornings and seems "more out of it" generally compared to
    1-2 years ago.
  Vision: Mother has not noticed visual changes but Eli has not had a
    formal eye exam (unable to cooperate). No obvious squinting or
    head tilting.
  GI: Poor appetite. On modified diet (thickened liquids, soft foods)
    per SLP recommendation for mild dysphagia.
  MSK: AFOs in place for bilateral ankle equinus. Mild scoliosis per
    orthopedics.

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:

  Mental Status: Eli is alert but appears less vigilant than expected for
  age. He is seated in his mother's lap. He does not acknowledge the
  examiner or respond to verbal greeting. He does not make eye contact.
  He is cooperative with the examination in a passive manner — does not
  resist but does not actively participate. Limited verbal interaction:
  said "mama" once during the 40-minute encounter. Did not follow any
  verbal commands during the examination. Continuous bilateral hand-
  wringing stereotypy observed throughout.

  Cranial Nerves:
    CN II: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light bilaterally (3mm to
      2mm). Visual fields: blinks to threat bilaterally, suggesting
      intact peripheral fields grossly. Fundoscopic examination attempted
      but limited by cooperation — brief view of right disc appeared
      normal, left disc not adequately visualized.
    CN III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements — eyes track a bright toy
      through full horizontal range. Vertical tracking limited by
      cooperation. No nystagmus observed in primary gaze or with
      lateral gaze. No ptosis.
    CN V: Facial sensation appears intact — withdraws to light touch
      bilaterally. Masseter strength not formally tested.
    CN VII: Face symmetric at rest and with crying (cried briefly during
      fundoscopic attempt). Mild drooling noted — may suggest subtle
      oromotor weakness.
    CN VIII: Turns to sound bilaterally (clapped hands). Formal
      audiometry not performed.
    CN IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically. Gag reflex present
      bilaterally. Voice (limited vocalizations): no hoarseness noted.
    CN XI: SCM and trapezius strength not formally tested — appears
      symmetric.
    CN XII: Tongue midline on protrusion (brief, observed during cry).
      No fasciculations.

  Motor:
    Bulk: Mildly decreased muscle bulk globally, particularly in
      distal lower extremities.
    Tone:
      Upper extremities: Decreased tone (hypotonia) bilaterally.
        Mild but definite.
      Lower extremities: Mildly increased tone (spasticity) bilaterally,
        greater in ankle plantarflexors. Velocity-dependent. Bilateral
        ankle equinus contracture present.
    Strength: Formal manual muscle testing not possible due to limited
      cooperation. Observed functional strength:
      - Able to lift arms against gravity and sustain briefly (4/5
        estimated)
      - Able to kick legs against gravity (4/5 estimated)
      - Grip: weak, unable to sustain grasp on examiner's finger for
        >2 seconds
      - No obvious asymmetry

  Reflexes:
    Biceps:     2+ bilaterally
    Triceps:    2+ bilaterally
    Patellar:   3+ bilaterally (brisk)
    Achilles:   3+ bilaterally (brisk), with 2-3 beats of clonus
                bilaterally (unsustained)
    Plantar:    Equivocal bilaterally (difficult to interpret given
                contracture and withdrawal response)

  Coordination:
    Finger-nose testing attempted: Eli reached toward the examiner's
    finger with a toy as target. Marked dysmetria observed — overshooting
    by approximately 3-4 cm on multiple attempts. Intention tremor
    noted in the terminal phase of reaching.
    Poor pincer grasp for age — unable to pick up a small bead; uses
    crude raking grasp.
    Rapid alternating movements: not testable due to cooperation.

  Gait:
    Observed with AFOs in place and mother holding one hand. Wide-based
    gait with significant lateral sway. Steps are short and shuffling.
    Bilateral toe-walking despite AFOs. Occasional foot-dragging noted,
    left > right. Eli took approximately 15 steps before requiring a
    rest. Without mother's hand, took 2 steps then lost balance
    (caught by mother).
    Heel walking: unable.
    Tandem gait: unable.
    Romberg: unable to assess due to cooperation and inability to stand
    with feet together.

  Stereotypic hand-wringing movements observed continuously throughout
  the examination. These are rhythmic, bilateral, and occur at midline.
  They appear involuntary and are not suppressible with distraction.

  During the examination, one staring episode was witnessed. At
  approximately the 25-minute mark, Eli suddenly ceased hand-wringing,
  became motionless, and stared ahead with subtle upward gaze deviation.
  Episode lasted approximately 12 seconds. He was unresponsive to
  name, clapping, and light touch on the shoulder during the episode.
  Following the episode, he appeared confused — looked around the room,
  appeared not to recognize his surroundings, and took approximately
  60 seconds to resume baseline behavior (hand-wringing, looking around).
  No convulsive movements were observed during this episode.

ASSESSMENT:

Eli is a 6-year, 1-month-old male with a diagnosis of ASD Level 2 who
presents with parental and provider concerns regarding developmental
regression and recurrent staring spells.

Neurological examination is notable for:
  1. Generalized mild hypotonia (upper > lower)
  2. Mild spasticity in lower extremities with ankle equinus contracture
  3. Brisk patellar and Achilles reflexes with unsustained ankle clonus
  4. Dysmetria and intention tremor on reaching
  5. Wide-based, ataxic gait requiring assistive support
  6. Poor fine motor skills with weak grip
  7. Continuous stereotypic hand-wringing
  8. Minimal verbal output
  9. Witnessed staring episode with post-episode confusion

Regarding the staring spells: The differential diagnosis includes absence
seizures versus behavioral inattention/dissociation, which is commonly
observed in patients with ASD. The episode witnessed during today's visit
was brief (12 seconds), non-convulsive, and self-limited. The post-episode
confusion, while concerning, can also be seen with behavioral dissociative
episodes in neurodevelopmental disorders. Given the brief, non-convulsive
nature, I will obtain an MRI of the brain to evaluate for structural causes
of the regression and staring spells. If the MRI is unrevealing and
episodes worsen (increased frequency, increased duration, or development
of convulsive features), I will proceed with EEG evaluation.

The developmental regression is concerning but may be attributable to the
natural history of ASD in the setting of moderate-severe intellectual
disability. Some degree of skill loss or plateau is not uncommon in this
population, particularly in the context of limited therapeutic response.

ICD-10 CODES:
  F84.0  — Autistic disorder
  R40.4  — Transient alteration of awareness (staring spells)
  R62.59 — Other and unspecified lack of expected normal physiological
            development (developmental regression)
  R26.0  — Ataxic gait
  G80.0  — Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy — rule out (pending imaging)

PLAN:
  1. MRI Brain without and with contrast — ordered (scheduling to follow).
     Evaluate for structural abnormalities, white matter disease,
     posterior fossa pathology, or other causes of regression and ataxia.
  2. Laboratory studies: not ordered at this time. Basic labs (CBC, lead)
     recently normal per Dr. Huang. If MRI demonstrates abnormalities
     suggestive of metabolic disease, will order targeted metabolic workup.
  3. EEG: will consider if MRI is unrevealing and staring spells worsen
     or develop convulsive features. At this time, the brief, non-
     convulsive nature of the episodes does not mandate emergent EEG.
  4. Return to clinic after MRI for review of results and further planning.
  5. In the interim: continue current supports (AFOs, school services,
     dysphagia precautions). If any convulsive seizure activity or
     prolonged episode (>2 minutes), present to ED.

RADIOLOGY REPORT

PATIENT:           Eli Reeves
DOB:               03/15/2012
MRN:               ONA-18-02491
DATE OF EXAM:      04/24/2018
PATIENT AGE:       6 years, 1 month
ORDERING PROVIDER: Robert Chen, MD
READING RADIOLOGIST: Dr. Sunita Patel, MD
                     Board Certified — Neuroradiology

EXAMINATION: MRI Brain without and with contrast

CLINICAL INDICATION: Autism spectrum disorder with developmental regression,
staring spells, ataxic gait. Evaluate for structural pathology.

TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed on a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Magnetom
Aera scanner without and with intravenous administration of 4 mL Gadavist
(gadobutrol) contrast. Sedation was administered by pediatric anesthesiology
(propofol) for the duration of the study due to inability to cooperate
with the examination.

Sequences obtained:
  - Sagittal T1-weighted (pre- and post-contrast)
  - Axial T1-weighted (pre- and post-contrast)
  - Axial T2-weighted
  - Axial FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)
  - Axial DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) with ADC map
  - Axial SWI (susceptibility-weighted imaging)
  - Coronal T2-weighted

COMPARISON: No prior imaging available at this facility. Per clinical
history, patient reportedly had an MRI at age 3 (2015) at an outside
facility that was normal. Outside images were not available for comparison.

FINDINGS:

  Ventricles and CSF Spaces:
    - Lateral ventricles are mildly prominent, left slightly greater than
      right. The ventricular configuration is smooth without irregular
      margins. The frontal horns, bodies, and occipital horns are mildly
      dilated.
    - Third ventricle: upper limits of normal in size (6 mm).
    - Fourth ventricle: normal in size and configuration.
    - No periventricular signal abnormality on FLAIR to suggest
      transependymal CSF flow or acute hydrocephalus.
    - Cerebral sulci are within normal limits for age.

  Cerebral Hemispheres:
    - Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved.
    - No focal signal abnormality in the cerebral white matter on T2
      or FLAIR sequences.
    - No restricted diffusion on DWI/ADC to suggest acute ischemia.
    - No abnormal enhancement following contrast administration.
    - Cortical thickness and gyral pattern appear normal.
    - No heterotopia or cortical malformation identified.

  Cerebellum:
    - Cerebellar hemispheres appear grossly normal in signal intensity.
    - Cerebellar folia are within normal limits for age.
    - No focal lesion.
    - Vermis is intact.
    NOTE: In retrospective review, cerebellar volume may be at the lower
    end of normal for age; however, without prior comparison imaging
    available at this facility, this cannot be definitively assessed as
    abnormal. The cerebellar appearance is within the range of normal
    variation for a 6-year-old.

  Brainstem:
    - Normal in size and signal intensity.
    - No focal lesion.

  Corpus Callosum:
    - Intact. Normal thickness and signal intensity throughout.

  Sella/Pituitary:
    - Normal.

  Extra-axial Spaces:
    - No extra-axial collection or mass.
    - No midline shift.

  Skull and Orbits:
    - Normal calvarium. No fracture.
    - Orbits are normal. Globes are symmetric.

  Vascular:
    - Major intracranial vessels demonstrate normal flow voids.
    - No vascular malformation identified.

  Post-Contrast:
    - No abnormal parenchymal or meningeal enhancement.

IMPRESSION:
  1. Mildly prominent lateral ventricles, left slightly greater than
     right, likely representing a developmental variant. No imaging
     features to suggest obstructive hydrocephalus.
  2. No acute intracranial pathology.
  3. No white matter signal abnormality to suggest leukodystrophy or
     demyelinating process.
  4. No posterior fossa abnormality.
  5. No mass lesion. No abnormal enhancement.
  6. Clinical correlation recommended.

NOTE: If clinical concern for neurodegenerative process persists,
comparison with prior outside imaging (reportedly obtained at age 3)
is recommended, as interval changes may be subtle and not appreciable
on a single study without comparison.

RE:    Eli Reeves (DOB: 03/15/2012)
       MRN: ONA-18-02491

Dear Dr. Huang,

Thank you for referring Eli Reeves to our practice for evaluation of
developmental regression and staring spells in the context of autism
spectrum disorder.

I evaluated Eli on April 10, 2018. Neurological examination was notable for
generalized mild hypotonia in the upper extremities, mild spasticity in the
lower extremities with ankle equinus contracture, brisk lower extremity
reflexes with unsustained ankle clonus, and an ataxic, wide-based gait
requiring support. Fine motor skills were impaired, with poor pincer grasp
and weak grip. Continuous stereotypic hand-wringing was observed. Verbal
output was markedly limited (one word during the encounter). One staring
episode was witnessed during the visit, lasting approximately 12 seconds,
without convulsive features, with brief post-episode confusion.

MRI of the brain performed on April 24, 2018 demonstrates mildly prominent
lateral ventricles that are most likely a developmental variant. There is
no evidence of acute intracranial pathology, white matter disease,
posterior fossa abnormality, or mass lesion. The MRI does not demonstrate
a structural cause for the developmental regression or staring episodes.

Given the absence of structural pathology on imaging and the well-
established diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, the staring spells
are most likely behavioral in nature — representing episodes of inattention
or dissociation that are commonly observed in individuals with ASD and
intellectual disability. The developmental regression, while concerning, may
reflect the natural trajectory of ASD with moderate intellectual disability,
where some skill loss or plateau can occur particularly in the context of
environmental change and limited therapeutic response.

I recommend continued monitoring of the staring episodes. If the episodes
increase significantly in frequency or duration, if any convulsive activity
is observed (tonic stiffening, clonic jerking, loss of consciousness with
fall), or if the family or school reports a marked escalation in symptoms,
please re-refer for EEG evaluation. At this time, given the clinical
presentation and normal structural imaging, I do not believe emergent EEG
is indicated.

If the developmental regression continues to progress, consideration may
be given to metabolic or genetic evaluation, though the current clinical
picture is most consistent with ASD-related regression.

I appreciate the opportunity to participate in Eli's care. Please do not
hesitate to contact my office if further questions or concerns arise.

Sincerely,

I. PRESENT LEVELS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE

  A. Communication:
     Eli communicates primarily through gestures (reaching, leading by
     hand) and limited vocalizations. He uses approximately 8-10
     recognizable words inconsistently ("mama," "dada," "no," "more,"
     "go," "juice," "ball," "bye," "up," "help"). He does not combine
     words into phrases. He does not respond consistently to his name
     (approximately 30% of the time). He follows simple one-step
     directions inconsistently (approximately 50% of the time for
     familiar, routine directions such as "sit down" or "come here").
     He does not answer questions. He does not engage in conversational
     turn-taking.
     Per SLP assessment (10/2016): receptive language age equivalent
     approximately 12-14 months; expressive language age equivalent
     approximately 10-12 months.

  B. Social/Emotional:
     Eli does not initiate social interactions with peers or unfamiliar
     adults. He will occasionally seek proximity to familiar adults
     (mother, 1:1 aide). He does not engage in cooperative or parallel
     play. He shows minimal awareness of peers in the classroom. He does
     not share, take turns, or imitate peers. He cries when overstimulated
     (loud noises, crowded spaces) but is generally calm in structured,
     predictable environments.

  C. Motor Skills:
     Fine motor: Eli demonstrates a crude palmar grasp on writing
     instruments. He can stack 3-4 blocks. He can turn pages of a board
     book (one at a time, with effort). He can button large buttons on a
     dressing frame (inconsistent — succeeds approximately 60% of
     attempts). He has difficulty with small manipulatives (beads, pegs).
     Per OT assessment: fine motor skills approximately 18-24 month level.

     Gross motor: Eli walks independently with a wide-based gait and
     intermittent bilateral toe-walking. He navigates stairs with railing
     and step-to pattern. He falls approximately 2-3 times per school day
     during transitions. He does not run smoothly — attempts to run
     result in stumbling. He can climb onto child-sized furniture. He
     does not jump, hop, or skip.
     Per OT assessment: gross motor skills approximately 20-26 month level.

  D. Adaptive Behavior:
     Eli requires assistance with most self-care tasks. He can wash his
     hands with 1-2 verbal prompts. He feeds himself with a spoon (some
     spillage). He drinks from an open cup with occasional spilling. He
     is not toilet trained. He requires assistance with dressing but can
     pull up elastic-waist pants with help and button large buttons
     (inconsistently). He does not manage zippers or snaps.

  E. Cognitive/Academic:
     Eli matches 4 colors (red, blue, yellow, green) on a field of 3.
     He identifies 5 body parts (head, eyes, nose, mouth, hands). He
     sorts objects by one attribute (color or shape, not both). He does
     not identify letters, numbers, or shapes by name. He does not count
     objects. He attends to structured activities for approximately
     2-3 minutes before disengaging.
     Per school psychologist assessment: cognitive functioning estimated
     in the 60-75 range (mild to moderate intellectual disability).

  F. Health/Medical:
     Per school nurse and parent report: Eli experiences staring episodes
     (4-6 per day, lasting 5-15 seconds) with brief post-episode
     confusion. Medical evaluation is ongoing. No formal seizure diagnosis.
     See Health Plan.
     Bilateral toe-walking — no orthotics at this time.
     Behavioral health: ABA therapy at Buckeye Behavioral Health
     (25 hrs/week, outside school hours).

II. MEASURABLE ANNUAL GOALS

  Goal 1 — Communication (Expressive):
  By 11/13/2017, Eli will use words, signs, or PECS to request (mand)
  10 preferred items/activities across at least 3 different settings
  (classroom, lunch, playground) with 80% accuracy over 3 consecutive
  data collection days.
  Baseline: 4-6 mands using words or signs
  Measurement: SLP and special education teacher data collection, monthly

  Goal 2 — Communication (Receptive):
  By 11/13/2017, Eli will follow 10 different one-step directions (e.g.,
  "sit down," "give me the ___," "put it in," "stand up") with 80%
  accuracy over 3 consecutive data collection days.
  Baseline: Follows 5 directions with approximately 50% accuracy
  Measurement: Special education teacher data collection, monthly

  Goal 3 — Social Skills:
  By 11/13/2017, Eli will engage in parallel play alongside a peer for
  at least 3 minutes without adult prompting, across 3 of 5 opportunities.
  Baseline: Does not engage in parallel play; tolerates peer proximity
  for approximately 30 seconds
  Measurement: Special education teacher observation, biweekly

  Goal 4 — Fine Motor:
  By 11/13/2017, Eli will use a pincer grasp to pick up small objects
  (beads, cheerios, small pegs) and place them in a container with 80%
  accuracy across 3 consecutive sessions.
  Baseline: Uses crude raking/palmar grasp; pincer grasp inconsistent
  Measurement: OT data collection, monthly

  Goal 5 — Gross Motor / Safety:
  By 11/13/2017, Eli will navigate 4 stairs (ascending and descending)
  using a railing with alternating feet and no falls, across 3 of 5
  opportunities.
  Baseline: Navigates stairs with railing and step-to pattern; falls
  approximately 1 time per 5 stair attempts
  Measurement: OT/special education teacher observation, monthly

  Goal 6 — Adaptive / Self-Care:
  By 11/13/2017, Eli will independently complete a 3-step hand washing
  routine (wet hands, apply soap, rinse) with no more than 1 verbal
  prompt, across 4 of 5 opportunities.
  Baseline: Completes hand washing with 1-2 verbal prompts
  Measurement: Special education teacher/aide data collection, monthly

V. PLACEMENT

  Least Restrictive Environment: Eli will be educated in the inclusive
  preschool classroom with 1:1 aide support and pull-out related services.
  He will participate in all general education activities with
  modifications and supports. The IEP team determined that with the
  identified supports and services, the inclusive preschool setting is
  the least restrictive environment appropriate for Eli at this time.

  LRE Percentage: Eli will spend approximately 80% of his school day
  in the general education setting (with 1:1 support).

I. REVIEW OF ANNUAL GOALS — PROGRESS SUMMARY

  Goal 1 — Communication (Expressive): Mand for 10 items across settings
    Status: NOT MET
    Progress: At this time, Eli mands for approximately 3 items using
    single words ("mama," "no," "more"), DOWN from baseline of 4-6 mands.
    PECS was introduced in January 2017; Eli used PECS to exchange pictures
    for 4 items by May 2017 but has since regressed — currently exchanges
    for 1-2 items inconsistently. REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.

  Goal 2 — Communication (Receptive): Follow 10 one-step directions
    Status: NOT MET
    Progress: Eli follows approximately 2 one-step directions ("come here,"
    "sit down") with 40% accuracy. This is a DECLINE from baseline (5
    directions, 50% accuracy). He no longer responds to several directions
    he previously followed (e.g., "give me the ___," "put it in").
    REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.

  Goal 3 — Social Skills: Parallel play for 3 minutes
    Status: NOT MET
    Progress: Eli tolerates peer proximity for approximately 15-20 seconds.
    He does not engage in parallel play. Minimal change from baseline but
    no regression. NO PROGRESS.

  Goal 4 — Fine Motor: Pincer grasp for small objects
    Status: NOT MET
    Progress: Eli's fine motor skills have DECLINED. He is no longer able
    to use a pincer grasp consistently. He relies on a raking/palmar grasp
    for most objects. He can no longer button large buttons on a dressing
    frame (this was present at baseline but has been LOST). He has
    difficulty holding a crayon and makes only brief, uncontrolled marks.
    SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.

  Goal 5 — Gross Motor / Stairs: Navigate 4 stairs with railing
    Status: NOT MET
    Progress: Eli's gross motor skills have DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY. He now
    requires hand-over-hand assistance on all stairs (previously used
    railing with step-to pattern independently). He falls approximately
    4-6 times per school day (up from 2-3 at baseline). His gait has
    become more unsteady with visible lateral sway. He no longer attempts
    to run. He requires assistance transitioning from floor to standing.
    SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.

  Goal 6 — Adaptive / Hand Washing: Independent 3-step routine
    Status: NOT MET
    Progress: Eli now requires full physical assistance for hand washing.
    He previously completed the routine with 1-2 verbal prompts at
    baseline. He is less responsive to verbal prompts across all
    adaptive routines. REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.

  SUMMARY: Eli has not met any of his six annual IEP goals. Of greater
  concern, he has lost previously mastered skills across multiple domains.
  Goals from the initial IEP period that were marked as "baseline/emerging
  skills" at the start of the year are now below baseline or absent.
  Specifically:
    - Expressive mands: declined from 4-6 to 3
    - Receptive directions: declined from 5 at 50% to 2 at 40%
    - Buttoning: present at baseline, now absent
    - Stair navigation: independent with railing at baseline, now
      requires hand-over-hand assistance
    - Hand washing: 1-2 prompts at baseline, now full physical assistance

  The IEP team expresses significant concern about this pattern of
  regression and recommends comprehensive re-evaluation.

II. UPDATED PRESENT LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE

  Communication: Eli now uses approximately 3-4 single words. He does not
  combine words. PECS use has declined. He follows 2 familiar directions
  inconsistently. SLP reports receptive language has declined from
  approximately 12-14 month equivalent to approximately 10-12 month
  equivalent. Expressive language has declined from approximately 10-12
  month equivalent to approximately 8-10 month equivalent.

  Motor: Fine motor has declined from approximately 18-24 month level to
  approximately 12-16 month level per OT. Gross motor has declined from
  approximately 20-26 month level to approximately 14-18 month level per
  OT. Eli now has near-constant toe-walking and significantly unsteady
  gait. He is being evaluated for AFOs per medical provider.

  Adaptive: Eli requires maximum assistance for all self-care tasks. He
  has lost the ability to button, use a spoon effectively (now frequently
  drops spoon; finger-feeding or adult-assisted feeding for most meals),
  and wash hands independently.

  Cognitive: Eli no longer matches colors consistently (previously matched
  4; now matches 1 — red — inconsistently). He no longer identifies body
  parts on command. He does not sort objects. Attention to structured
  activities has decreased to approximately 30-60 seconds before
  disengagement.

  Staring episodes: Per school nurse documentation, staring episodes occur
  approximately 4-8 times per school day, lasting 10-25 seconds, with
  post-episode confusion of 1-3 minutes. Eye fluttering has been observed
  during some episodes. Medical evaluation is ongoing (MRI scheduled per
  parent).

III. REVISED ANNUAL GOALS (2018-2019)

  [Goals revised downward to reflect current functioning levels. All goals
  are written as maintenance or minimal-acquisition targets given pattern
  of regression.]

  Goal 1 — Communication: Eli will use any modality (word, sign, PECS,
  gesture) to request 5 preferred items/activities with 60% accuracy
  across 3 data days.
  Baseline: 3 mands (words)

  Goal 2 — Motor Safety: Eli will walk independently (with AFOs when
  fitted) for a distance of 50 feet in the school hallway with no more
  than 1 fall, across 4 of 5 opportunities.
  Baseline: Falls 4-6x/day; requires hand support for hallway travel

  Goal 3 — Adaptive: Eli will participate in a 3-step self-care routine
  (hand washing, tooth brushing, or face washing) with no more than
  partial physical assistance at each step, across 3 of 5 opportunities.
  Baseline: Requires full physical assistance

  Goal 4 — Engagement: Eli will attend to a structured tabletop activity
  for 2 continuous minutes without a disengagement episode, across 3 of
  5 opportunities.
  Baseline: Attention span approximately 30-60 seconds with frequent
  disengagement episodes

V. IEP TEAM RECOMMENDATION

The IEP team recommends comprehensive re-evaluation (multi-factored
evaluation / ETR) to reassess Eli's cognitive, adaptive, communication,
and motor functioning in light of the significant regression observed
this year. The team also recommends that the results of the re-evaluation,
combined with ongoing medical findings, be used to determine whether a
change in educational placement (from inclusive setting to self-contained
classroom) is appropriate.

Parent (Denise Reeves) consents to the proposed re-evaluation.
Re-evaluation target date: 03/2018.

REFERRAL SOURCE:      IEP Team (Annual Review, 01/22/2018)
REASON FOR REFERRAL:  Comprehensive re-evaluation due to significant
                      developmental regression across all domains observed
                      during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years.

I. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Eli Reeves is a 6-year, 0-month-old biracial (Black/White) male currently
enrolled in kindergarten at Maple Grove Elementary School. He receives
special education services under the disability category of Autism, with
an IEP in place since November 2016.

Eli was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2, at age 3 years,
6 months by Dr. Marcus Whitfield at Blue Ridge Developmental Pediatrics
in Roanoke, Virginia. At that time, a Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler
Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) was administered (age 3 years,
5 months), yielding the following composite scores:
  - Cognitive: 72 (3rd percentile — borderline)
  - Language: 62 (1st percentile — extremely low)
  - Motor: 68 (2nd percentile — extremely low)

The family relocated to Columbus, Ohio in May 2016. Eli received intensive
ABA therapy (25 hrs/week) at Buckeye Behavioral Health from May 2016 to
July 2017. Per ABA discharge summary, Eli did not make progress and
demonstrated "progressive decline in previously acquired skills across
all developmental domains."

Since enrollment at Maple Grove Elementary (Fall 2016), the IEP team has
documented progressive regression in communication, motor, adaptive, and
cognitive skills. Eli has not met any IEP goals and has lost multiple
baseline skills. The IEP team requested this re-evaluation to determine
current cognitive functioning and to investigate the nature and extent of
the regression.

II. EVALUATION PROCEDURES

The following assessments and procedures were utilized:

  1. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V)
     — partial administration
  2. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3)
     — Parent/Caregiver Rating Form (completed by Denise Reeves)
  3. Review of educational records, IEP documentation, and ABA therapy
     records
  4. Behavioral observations during testing
  5. Teacher interview (Lauren Mitchell, M.Ed.; Brian Kowalski)
  6. Parent interview (Denise Reeves)

III. BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS DURING TESTING

Testing was conducted over two sessions (03/12/2018 and 03/14/2018)
in the school psychology office. Eli was accompanied to the testing room
by his 1:1 aide (Ms. Thompson). He walked with a wide-based, unsteady
gait; the aide held his hand for support.

Eli did not acknowledge the examiner or make eye contact during either
session. He sat in an adapted chair with lateral supports. Continuous
bilateral hand-wringing was observed throughout both sessions.

Eli's verbal output during testing was extremely limited — he said "no"
twice and "mama" once across both sessions. He did not respond to verbal
directions or questions from the examiner.

Multiple staring episodes were observed: 6 episodes across the two
testing sessions (total testing time approximately 90 minutes). Episodes
lasted 10-25 seconds. During episodes, Eli became completely motionless
and unresponsive. Eye fluttering was observed during 3 of the 6 episodes.
Post-episode, Eli appeared disoriented for 1-3 minutes. These episodes
significantly impacted the testing process.

Eli demonstrated very limited engagement with test materials. He
occasionally looked at picture stimuli but did not point, verbalize, or
otherwise indicate responses to most items. When physically guided to
manipulate blocks or objects, he had difficulty maintaining grasp and
dropped materials frequently.

Given the significant limitations in Eli's ability to engage with
standardized testing procedures, only a partial WISC-V administration was
possible. Results should be interpreted as an ESTIMATE of cognitive
functioning and may UNDERESTIMATE Eli's true abilities due to the
confounding effects of motor impairment, communication limitation, and
possible seizure activity during testing.

IV. COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT — WISC-V (PARTIAL ADMINISTRATION)

The following subtests were attempted:

  Subtest                  Attempted    Completed    Scaled Score

  Picture Span             Yes          Partial      (2)*
  Symbol Search            Yes          No           Unable to score

  * Scores in parentheses represent estimated scaled scores based on
    partial administration. These are approximations only.

  Subtests not completed due to: inability to provide verbal responses
  (Similarities, Vocabulary); inability to manipulate pencil for timed
  tasks (Coding, Symbol Search); inability to sustain attention due to
  staring episodes (Digit Span — episode occurred during administration).

  ESTIMATED COMPOSITE SCORES (based on available subtests — interpret
  with extreme caution):

  Index                              Estimated Score    Percentile    CI (95%)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Full Scale IQ (FSIQ)               58*               0.3           52-67
  Visual Spatial Index (VSI)          55*               0.1           49-66
  Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI)         60*               0.4           54-70
  * Prorated/estimated based on partial administration. These scores do
    NOT meet standard administration criteria and should be interpreted
    as approximate estimates of cognitive functioning only.

  CLASSIFICATION: Estimated FSIQ of 58 falls in the Extremely Low range
  (Intellectual Disability — Moderate).

VI. COMPARISON WITH PRIOR COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT

  Assessment        Age       Instrument     Cognitive Score    Classification
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2015 (Virginia)   3y 5m     Bayley-III     72 (Cognitive)     Borderline
  2018 (current)    6y 0m     WISC-V (est.)  58 (FSIQ est.)     Extremely Low

  SCORE CHANGE: Decline of approximately 14 standard score points
  (approximately 1 standard deviation) over a 2.5-year period.

  INTERPRETATION: While some degree of score difference between the
  Bayley-III and WISC-V is expected due to differences in test construction,
  norms, and the skills assessed, the magnitude of the decline observed
  here (>1 SD) is unusual and exceeds what would be expected from
  instrument differences alone. Research on Bayley-III to WISC-V prediction
  suggests that Bayley cognitive scores tend to slightly overestimate later
  IQ scores by approximately 3-7 points in children with developmental
  delays. Even accounting for this, the observed decline of 14 points is
  notable and suggests genuine loss of cognitive abilities.

  This pattern of cognitive decline, combined with the documented regression
  in motor, communication, and adaptive skills across ABA therapy records,
  IEP progress monitoring, and clinical observation, represents a
  significant and concerning trajectory.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Eli Reeves is a 6-year-old male with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum
Disorder who demonstrates significant cognitive, communicative, motor,
and adaptive deficits. Current estimated cognitive functioning falls in
the Extremely Low range (estimated FSIQ 58), representing a meaningful
decline from his Bayley-III cognitive score of 72 obtained 2.5 years ago.

Of primary concern is the pattern of progressive skill regression
documented by multiple sources (ABA therapy, IEP progress data, parent
report, clinical observation) across all developmental domains. This
regression is significant in both scope (affecting motor, communication,
cognitive, and adaptive domains simultaneously) and magnitude (loss of
multiple previously acquired skills including buttoning, stair navigation,
color matching, and multiple receptive language tasks).

While some degree of regression can occur in some presentations of autism
spectrum disorder — particularly during periods of transition or stress,
and some ASD subtypes (e.g., regressive autism) involve an early period
of skill loss typically occurring between 15-24 months — the ongoing,
progressive, multi-year pattern of skill loss observed in Eli is atypical
for ASD. In most cases of regressive autism, the regression occurs in early
toddlerhood and is followed by a plateau or gradual skill re-acquisition,
not by continued progressive decline through school age.

The school psychologist notes the following concerns that warrant
medical investigation:

  1. The progressive, multi-domain nature of the regression (motor,
     cognitive, communicative, adaptive) occurring over a 2+ year period
     and continuing at age 6 years
  2. The significant decline in cognitive scores (estimated 14-point
     decrease) exceeding what would be expected from assessment instrument
     differences
  3. The staring episodes observed during testing, which have features
     concerning for seizure activity (abrupt onset, unresponsiveness,
     eye fluttering, post-episode confusion)
  4. The progressive motor deterioration (gait instability, loss of fine
     motor skills, emerging spasticity per medical records) which is not
     a typical feature of ASD

RECOMMENDATIONS:

  1. EDUCATIONAL: Change in disability category should be considered.
     While Autism remains appropriate as a primary category, the IEP team
     should consider adding "Multiple Disabilities" or "Traumatic Brain
     Injury/Other Health Impairment" as the presentation evolves and
     additional medical information becomes available.

  2. EDUCATIONAL: Change in placement recommended — from inclusive
     kindergarten with 1:1 aide to self-contained special education
     classroom (multiple disabilities unit) with reduced student-to-
     teacher ratio and access to related services within the classroom.

  3. MEDICAL: Comprehensive medical evaluation is strongly recommended
     to investigate the cause of the progressive developmental regression.
     While this school psychologist is not qualified to make medical
     diagnoses, the pattern observed is, in this evaluator's professional
     opinion, atypical for ASD alone and warrants investigation for
     possible neurological, metabolic, or genetic conditions that may be
     contributing to or causing the regression.

  4. RELATED SERVICES: Increase in speech-language therapy, occupational
     therapy, and addition of physical therapy services recommended to
     address declining motor function.

  5. ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY: Formal assistive technology evaluation
     recommended given declining communication and motor skills.

  6. RE-EVALUATION: If medical evaluation reveals an underlying condition,
     re-evaluation of educational classification and services should be
     conducted promptly.

                     END OF MEDICAL RECORDS — SECTION 2
                    PATIENT: ELI REEVES (DOB: 03/15/2012)
                         AGES 4 YEARS – 7 YEARS
                    COVERING DATES: 05/2016 – 03/2019

  SECTION SUMMARY:
  This section documents the critical period during which Eli Reeves
  received 14 months of intensive ABA therapy with no progress and
  progressive regression, was evaluated by a pediatrician who monitored
  but deferred, and was seen by a neurologist who ordered MRI but not
  EEG. Multiple providers (BCBA, school psychologist, school nurse)
  raised concerns about possible seizure activity and atypical
  regression. The ASD diagnosis was never questioned despite mounting
  evidence of a progressive neurological process.

  KEY MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS SECTION:
  1. EEG was never ordered despite multiple providers observing and
     documenting episodes consistent with absence seizures
  2. Neurologist accepted ASD diagnosis and attributed regression to
     ASD natural history
  3. MRI read as "mildly prominent ventricles — likely normal variant"
     without comparison to age-3 MRI (not available at Ohio facility);
     possible early cerebellar volume loss was not appreciated
  4. No metabolic workup was ordered despite progressive multi-domain
     regression
  5. No genetic testing was considered
  6. Pediatrician deferred to neurology; neurologist deferred further
     workup pending "worsening" — creating a gap in which no one
     pursued the underlying cause
  7. Wait times for specialty care (3-6 months for neurology) resulted
     in significant delays during a period of rapid decline

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Eli is a 7-year-old mixed-race male referred by Dr. Patricia Huang (Pediatrics)
for evaluation of progressive gait abnormality and concern for developing
scoliosis. Per mother, Danielle Reeves, Eli was diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorder at age 3 and has had progressive motor difficulties over the past
2–3 years. She reports he was walking independently by 15 months but began
stumbling frequently around age 5. Falls have increased to 3–4 times daily.
He now requires assistance on stairs and uneven surfaces. Mother states she
has noticed his spine appears "curved" when bathing him, which prompted the
referral.

Mother reports Eli has also had worsening speech, now limited to short 2–3
word phrases, and episodes of "staring" that occur 2–3 times per day lasting
10–20 seconds. She is increasingly concerned that his difficulties extend
beyond his ASD diagnosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  - Autism spectrum disorder (diagnosed age 3, Dr. Yuen, Nationwide Children's)
  - Speech/language delay
  - Gross motor delay
  - History of frequent falls

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
  - None

MEDICATIONS:
  - Melatonin 3 mg QHS (sleep)
  - Multivitamin daily

ALLERGIES:  NKDA

FAMILY HISTORY:
  - Mother: healthy, age 31
  - Father: healthy, age 33
  - No known family history of scoliosis or neuromuscular disease
  - Maternal grandmother: type 2 diabetes
  - No consanguinity

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Patient lives with mother and father. Attends 2nd grade at Columbus City
Schools with IEP and 1:1 aide. Receives school-based OT and speech therapy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  Constitutional:   Decreased energy, tires easily. Weight stable.
  HEENT:            No visual complaints per parent, last eye exam 6 months ago
  Musculoskeletal:  Progressive gait difficulty, frequent falls, trunk asymmetry
  Neurological:     Staring episodes, speech regression, clumsiness
  All other systems reviewed and negative

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Vitals:
    Height:         119.4 cm (10th percentile)
    Weight:          21.3 kg (8th percentile)
    BMI:             14.9 (32nd percentile)

  General:          Thin male, cooperative but limited verbal interaction.
                    Fidgeting in chair. Intermittent hand-wringing movements.

  Spine:
    - Standing forward bend test: mild rightward thoracic prominence
    - Scoliometer reading: 8 degrees at T8 level
    - No palpable midline defect
    - No skin stigmata (café-au-lait spots, hairy patch, dimple)
    - Shoulder heights asymmetric, right slightly elevated
    - Pelvis level

  Extremities:
    - Full ROM bilateral upper and lower extremities
    - No limb length discrepancy
    - Bilateral pes planus, moderate
    - Hindfoot valgus bilaterally, left > right
    - No joint contractures

  Gait:
    - Wide-based gait
    - Truncal sway prominent
    - Difficulty with tandem gait — unable to complete
    - Mild circumduction of left lower extremity
    - Romberg: positive (sways significantly with eyes closed)

  Neurological (screening):
    - Tone: mildly increased bilateral lower extremities
    - Strength: grossly 4/5 bilateral LE, 4+/5 bilateral UE
    - DTRs: 2+ bilateral upper extremities, 3+ bilateral LE (brisk)
    - Babinski: equivocal bilaterally
    - Finger-to-nose: mild dysmetria bilaterally
    - Heel-to-shin: poor tracking bilaterally

IMAGING:
  PA and lateral standing scoliosis radiographs obtained today:
    - Right thoracic curve measuring 12 degrees (Cobb angle), apex T8
    - No left lumbar compensatory curve
    - Risser sign: 0 (skeletally immature)
    - No congenital vertebral anomalies identified
    - No pedicle widening or canal abnormality

ASSESSMENT:
1. Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis, right thoracic curve 12 degrees — mild.
   Given skeletal immaturity (Risser 0), risk of progression is moderate.
2. Progressive gait abnormality with wide-based ataxic pattern — NOTABLY
   ATYPICAL for ASD. The combination of positive Romberg, dysmetria,
   brisk reflexes, and equivocal Babinski raises concern for an underlying
   neurological process beyond ASD.
3. Bilateral pes planus with hindfoot valgus — contributing to gait
   instability.

PLAN:
1. Scoliosis: Monitor with repeat radiographs in 3 months. No bracing
   indicated at this time (curve <20 degrees). If progression >5 degrees
   or curve exceeds 20 degrees, will initiate bracing.
2. Custom bilateral ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) — articulating, to address
   pes planus, hindfoot valgus, and provide ankle stability during gait.
   Referral to orthotics placed today.
3. Physical therapy referral — Nationwide Children's Outpatient Rehab for
   gait training, balance, and core strengthening. Recommend 2x/week.
4. *** I am noting concern regarding the PROGRESSIVE nature of this child's
   motor difficulties. The neurological examination findings (dysmetria,
   ataxia, brisk reflexes, equivocal plantar responses) are NOT consistent
   with a static encephalopathy or typical ASD motor features. I would
   strongly recommend re-evaluation by Pediatric Neurology to rule out
   a progressive neurological condition. Discussed with mother who reports
   she has raised similar concerns with Dr. Huang previously. ***
5. Return to clinic in 3 months for scoliosis monitoring and AFO check.

RECORD 6.2 — ORTHOPEDIC 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP
Date of Service:    October 28, 2019
Patient Age:        7 years, 7 months
Visit Type:         Follow-Up
ICD-10:             M41.114 (Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis, thoracic)
                    F84.0 (Autism spectrum disorder)
                    R26.0 (Ataxic gait)
                    M21.079 (Valgus deformity, unspec ankle)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Eli returns for 3-month follow-up of his thoracic scoliosis and AFO fitting.
Mother reports the AFOs were fabricated and dispensed in September 2019. She
states Eli has been wearing them approximately 6 hours/day during school. She
notes the AFOs have helped with ankle stability but that his overall balance
continues to worsen. He now requires hand-holding to walk on any uneven
surface. Falls have increased to 5–6 times daily despite the orthoses. He
fell down 3 steps at school last month, sustaining a forehead contusion (seen
at urgent care, no imaging obtained).

Mother also reports Eli has started physical therapy at Nationwide Children's
Outpatient Rehab (therapist: Sarah Lindgren, DPT). She states the therapist
has expressed concern that Eli's presentation is "not typical" for ASD.

Speech has continued to decline — now primarily single words and gestures.
Staring episodes continue 2–3 times daily. Mother has noticed Eli's body
"jerking" during sleep several times per week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Vitals:
    Height:         120.8 cm (9th percentile)
    Weight:          21.0 kg (7th percentile)
    BMI:             14.4 (27th percentile)

  General:    Thin male, wearing bilateral AFOs. Limited verbal output.
              Said "hi" and "mama" during visit.

  Spine:
    - Forward bend: persistent right thoracic prominence, possibly increased
    - Scoliometer: 10 degrees at T8

  AFO Assessment:
    - Bilateral articulating AFOs in good condition
    - Appropriate fit, no skin breakdown
    - Hindfoot alignment improved to neutral in orthoses

  Gait (with AFOs):
    - Remains wide-based
    - Increased truncal sway compared to July visit
    - Now intermittently reaching for walls/furniture for support
    - Unable to perform tandem gait

  Neurological (screening):
    - Tone: increased bilateral LE, mild spasticity at ankles
    - DTRs: 3+ bilateral LE
    - Dysmetria: worsened — now overshooting on finger-to-nose by ~3 cm
    - Intention tremor noted bilateral UE (NEW finding)

IMAGING:
  PA standing scoliosis radiograph:
    - Right thoracic curve now measures 14 degrees (Cobb), apex T8
    - Progression of 2 degrees over 3 months
    - Risser: 0

ASSESSMENT:
1. Juvenile scoliosis — progressed from 12 to 14 degrees over 3 months.
   Still below bracing threshold but trajectory concerning given skeletal
   immaturity.
2. Progressive gait deterioration with worsening ataxia, NEW intention
   tremor, and increasing spasticity — this is a PROGRESSIVE neurological
   process. I reiterate my concern from July that this is NOT consistent
   with ASD alone.
3. Nocturnal myoclonus per parent report — needs neurological evaluation.

PLAN:
1. Continue scoliosis monitoring — return in 5 months for repeat films.
   If curve reaches 20 degrees, will initiate TLSO bracing.
2. Continue bilateral AFOs. Mother reports good compliance. Added velcro
   strap modification for easier donning.
3. Continue PT — will communicate with Sarah Lindgren, DPT regarding
   worsening function.
4. *** URGENT: I am writing a formal addendum to my July recommendation
   for Pediatric Neurology re-evaluation. The appearance of intention
   tremor and progressive spasticity in a child with an existing ASD
   diagnosis demands urgent neurological workup. I will send a direct
   message to Dr. Huang requesting neurology referral. The scoliosis
   itself may be neuromuscular in etiology rather than idiopathic. ***
5. Mother tearful during visit. She states she has been researching her
   son's symptoms online and is frightened by what she has found. I
   validated her concerns and encouraged her to advocate for the neurology
   referral. Provided her with the Nationwide Children's Neurology
   scheduling number.

                    R26.0 (Ataxic gait)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Eli returns for scoliosis and gait follow-up. It has been approximately
5 months since last orthopedic visit. Mother reports SIGNIFICANT functional
decline since October. Eli now uses a posterior walker for distances greater
than 50 feet and is using a wheelchair for community mobility (school,
grocery store). He can still walk short distances indoors with the walker
and AFOs, but falls are now daily events.

Mother reports she requested a neurology referral through Dr. Huang in
November 2019 but was told the wait time for a new neurology appointment
is 4–5 months. An appointment is scheduled for March 2021 with Dr. Amara
Osei in Pediatric Neurology.

*** NOTE: The neurology appointment was initially scheduled for June 2020 but
was delayed to March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and clinic
shutdowns. Mother is extremely frustrated by this delay. ***

Speech has further declined — Eli now uses approximately 10–15 single words
and relies primarily on a picture communication board. Staring episodes
continue. Sleep jerking has increased to nightly per parent report.

Mother brought a letter from Eli's physical therapist, Sarah Lindgren, DPT,
dated March 4, 2020, expressing concern about a progressive neurological
condition. This letter is scanned into the chart (see Provider 7, Record 7.4).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Vitals:
    Height:         122.1 cm (8th percentile — dropping)
    Weight:          20.8 kg (6th percentile — dropping)
    BMI:             14.0 (19th percentile)

  General:    Thin male in posterior walker with bilateral AFOs. No verbal
              output during visit. Communicated by pointing to pictures
              on communication board.

  Spine:
    - Forward bend: definite right thoracic prominence, increased
    - Scoliometer: 14 degrees at T8
    - Truncal lean to right in standing

  Gait (with walker and AFOs):
    - Severely ataxic, wide-based
    - Significant truncal sway even with walker support
    - Scissoring pattern emerging at ankles
    - Walks approximately 30 feet before fatiguing
    - Cannot walk without assistive device

  Upper Extremities:
    - Marked intention tremor bilaterally
    - Difficulty grasping small objects
    - Cannot write name (previously could at age 6)

IMAGING:
  PA and lateral standing scoliosis radiographs (in walker):
    - Right thoracic curve now measures 18 degrees (Cobb), apex T7-8
    - Progression of 4 degrees over 5 months (6 degrees total since July)
    - Mild rotation at apex
    - Risser: 0

ASSESSMENT:
1. Progressive scoliosis — now 18 degrees, approaching bracing threshold.
   Rate of progression (6 degrees in 8 months) is RAPID for a prepubertal
   child. I am now classifying this as SECONDARY SCOLIOSIS, likely
   neuromuscular in etiology, rather than juvenile idiopathic. The pattern
   of long C-curve without compensatory curve is consistent with
   neuromuscular scoliosis.
2. Severe progressive gait deterioration — this child has gone from
   independent ambulation to walker-dependent in under 12 months. This
   is NOT consistent with ASD. This is a progressive neurological disease.
3. Progressive upper extremity dysfunction — intention tremor, loss of
   fine motor skills.

PLAN:
1. Initiate TLSO bracing for scoliosis. Referral to orthotics for custom
   TLSO. Curve approaching 20 degrees with rapid progression in a Risser 0
   child — high risk for continued progression.
2. Continue bilateral AFOs. Current pair showing wear — will need
   replacement in 2–3 months.
3. Continue PT for as long as functional gains or maintenance are possible.
4. *** I am writing a FORMAL LETTER to Dr. Patricia Huang and the
   Nationwide Children's Neurology department requesting EXPEDITED
   evaluation. This child has a clearly progressive neurodegenerative
   condition that has been attributed to ASD for over 4 years. The rate
   of motor decline is alarming. Every month of delay in diagnosis is a
   month of lost opportunity for potential treatment.

   I have discussed with mother the possibility of seeking a second
   opinion at Cincinnati Children's or Cleveland Clinic if the local
   neurology appointment cannot be moved up. Mother states she will
   call neurology scheduling tomorrow to request urgent status.

   For the record: I first recommended neurology re-evaluation on
   07/22/2019 and reiterated this on 10/28/2019. As of today's date,
   the patient has still not been seen by neurology. ***

5. Return in 4 months for scoliosis check and TLSO fitting assessment.
6. If scoliosis progresses beyond 40 degrees despite bracing, surgical
   consultation (posterior spinal fusion) will be discussed.

PATIENT BACKGROUND/REFERRAL INFORMATION:
Eli Reeves is a 7-year-5-month-old male referred by Dr. Michael Okafor
(Orthopedic Surgery) for gait training, balance intervention, and core
strengthening. Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (age 3). Progressive
gait abnormality and developing scoliosis. Recently fitted for bilateral
articulating AFOs (pending fabrication). Dr. Okafor's referral notes concern
for neurological process beyond ASD.

PARENT INTERVIEW:
Mother, Danielle Reeves, accompanied patient. She reports Eli walked
independently at 15 months. Gait was "always a little clumsy" but began
noticeably worsening around age 5. Over the past year, falls have increased
from occasional to 3–4 times daily. He can no longer run. He needs
hand-holding on stairs. He has difficulty getting up from the floor (uses
furniture to pull up). Mother is concerned his motor skills are going
"backwards" — she states he could ride a tricycle at age 4 but can no longer
do so. He used to be able to kick a ball but now cannot balance on one foot
at all.

Mother also reports speech regression (from sentences to short phrases),
staring episodes (2–3/day), and hand tremor when reaching for objects.

PRIOR THERAPY HISTORY:
  - Early Intervention PT (ages 18 months–3 years) — discharged
  - School-based OT (current, 1x/week, 30 min)
  - School-based speech therapy (current, 2x/week, 30 min)
  - No prior outpatient PT

    Dimension C (Crawling & Kneeling):     71%
    Dimension D (Standing):                56%
    Dimension E (Walking, Running, Jump):  37%
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
    TOTAL GMFM-88 SCORE:                  68%

  GMFCS Level:                             Level II (walks with limitations)

  Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS):           28/56
    (Normal for age: >50; at risk for falls: <40)

  Timed Up and Go (TUG):                  18.4 seconds
    (Normal for age 7: 5–6 seconds; SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED)

  6-Minute Walk Test:                      142 meters
    (Normal for age 7: ~470–550 meters; 26% of expected)

CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:

  Posture (standing):
    - Wide base of support (~18 inches between heels)
    - Mild right thoracic scoliotic curve visible
    - Forward head posture
    - Bilateral genu recurvatum
    - Bilateral hindfoot valgus (corrected in AFOs — not yet received)

  Gait Analysis (without AFOs):
    - Cadence: 82 steps/min (normal ~130 for age)
    - Step length: shortened bilaterally, asymmetric (L < R)
    - Wide-based, lurching quality
    - Truncal sway — lateral excursion ~6 cm (excessive)
    - Absent heel strike bilaterally — flat foot contact
    - No reciprocal arm swing
    - Frequent loss of balance requiring recovery steps
    - Unable to walk >100 feet without rest break

  Balance:
    - Single-leg stance: R = 1.2 sec, L = 0.8 sec (norm >10 sec at age 7)
    - Tandem stance: unable to maintain >2 seconds
    - Tandem gait: unable — immediately steps out of line
    - Romberg: positive — marked posterior sway with eyes closed

  Coordination:
    - Finger-to-nose: dysmetric bilaterally, overshooting target
    - Rapid alternating movements (forearm pronation/supination): slow,
      irregular, dysdiadochokinetic
    - Heel-to-shin: unable to track smoothly, jerky trajectory

  Tone & Reflexes:
    - Mildly increased tone bilateral LE (Modified Ashworth 1)
    - Patellar DTRs: brisk (3+)
    - Ankle clonus: 2–3 beats bilaterally (unsustained)

  Functional Mobility:
    - Floor to stand: requires furniture support, Gowers-like pattern
    - Stair ascent: step-to pattern with bilateral rail, requires verbal
      cuing and intermittent physical assist
    - Stair descent: step-to pattern, max assist for safety
    - Seated balance: fair — can maintain but sways with perturbation

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
This is a 7-year-old male presenting with a movement pattern that includes
significant cerebellar signs (ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia,
intention tremor, wide-based gait) AND upper motor neuron signs (brisk
reflexes, ankle clonus, mildly increased tone). Per parent report, these
deficits are PROGRESSIVE — motor milestones were achieved and are now being
LOST. This pattern of regression is NOT consistent with a static condition
such as autism spectrum disorder or developmental coordination disorder.

While it is outside my scope of practice to diagnose, I want to clearly
document that Eli's presentation is concerning for a PROGRESSIVE
NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION and I support Dr. Okafor's recommendation for
urgent neurology evaluation.

GOALS (12-WEEK):
1. Improve PBS score from 28 to 35/56
2. Improve TUG from 18.4 to 14 seconds
3. Maintain GMFM-88 total score ≥68%
4. Independent stair ascent with one rail (step-to pattern)
5. Safe ambulation with AFOs for 200 feet without rest
6. Caregiver education: home exercise program, fall prevention

PLAN:
  Frequency: 2x/week, 45-minute sessions
  Duration: 12 weeks (24 visits — full authorization)
  Focus: Balance training, gait training with AFOs (once received),
         core/hip strengthening, functional mobility, caregiver training

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERVAL STATUS:
Eli has attended 17 of 18 scheduled PT sessions (1 cancelled due to illness).
Bilateral articulating AFOs received in September 2019, now incorporated into
all gait activities. Despite consistent attendance and active participation,
Eli is demonstrating DECLINE in motor function rather than improvement.

Mother reports increasing falls at home (5–6/day). She purchased a gait
belt per my recommendation. Sleep jerking continues nightly. Staring
episodes now sometimes accompanied by lip-smacking movements.

STANDARDIZED RE-ASSESSMENT:

  Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88):
    Dimension A (Lying & Rolling):        90% (was 92%)

  6-Minute Walk Test:                      118 meters (was 142 — DECLINED)

GOAL REVIEW:
  Goal 1 (PBS 28→35): NOT MET — declined to 24. GOAL REVISED.
  Goal 2 (TUG 18.4→14): NOT MET — worsened to 22.1. GOAL REVISED.
  Goal 3 (Maintain GMFM ≥68%): NOT MET — declined to 64%.
  Goal 4 (Stairs, 1 rail): NOT MET — now requires bilateral rails + CGA.
  Goal 5 (Ambulate 200ft): NOT MET — max distance 90 ft with AFOs + CGA.
  Goal 6 (Caregiver HEP): PARTIALLY MET — mother performing HEP 4x/week.

NEW CLINICAL FINDINGS:
  - Intention tremor: MORE PRONOUNCED — now visible at rest as well as
    with movement (resting tremor component emerging)
  - Dysmetria: worsened — overshooting finger-to-nose by 4–5 cm
  - Truncal ataxia: worsened — cannot sit unsupported on therapy ball
  - Ankle clonus: now 4–5 beats bilaterally (was 2–3)
  - New finding: MYOCLONIC JERKS observed during session — brief,
    involuntary jerking of bilateral UE, occurred 3 times during
    45-minute session. Patient appeared briefly startled, then resumed
    activity.

THERAPIST ASSESSMENT:
This child is declining DESPITE intensive physical therapy intervention.
All standardized measures show regression over 3 months. The rate of
decline is accelerating. New findings of myoclonic jerks during therapy
and worsening of all cerebellar signs are deeply concerning.

I have communicated verbally with Dr. Okafor regarding my findings.
I understand a neurology referral has been placed but the appointment
is months away. I am requesting a formal interdisciplinary team
conference to discuss this patient's deteriorating status.

REVISED GOALS (next 6 weeks — MAINTENANCE FOCUSED):
1. Maintain PBS ≥22/56
2. Maintain safe household ambulation with AFOs and walker (50 ft)
3. Maintain seated balance for tabletop activities (15 min)
4. Caregiver training: wheelchair mobility, transfer techniques
5. Fall prevention strategies for home and school

PLAN:
  Continue PT 2x/week. Shifting focus from improvement to MAINTENANCE
  and SAFETY. Introducing posterior walker trial. Will initiate
  wheelchair assessment if ambulation continues to decline.

  Authorization renewal submitted to Anthem BCBS for additional 24 visits.

                    F84.0 (Autism spectrum disorder)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERVAL STATUS:
Eli has continued PT 2x/week since November. He now uses a posterior
walker (Rifton Pacer, size medium) for all walking. Wheelchair (Zippie
manual, tilt-in-space) obtained in January 2020 through insurance and is
used for school and community mobility. Mother reports he can walk about
20–30 feet with the walker before fatiguing. He requires moderate assist
for all transfers.

Speech is now limited to approximately 10 single words. Staring spells
now occur 3–4 times daily. Mother reports one episode where Eli's entire
body stiffened for approximately 20 seconds followed by confusion — this
occurred at school and the nurse called 911. He was evaluated at Nationwide
Children's ED (January 22, 2020) and discharged with a diagnosis of
"seizure vs. behavioral staring spell in child with ASD." No EEG performed.

STANDARDIZED RE-ASSESSMENT:

  Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88):
    Dimension A (Lying & Rolling):        85% (was 90%)
    Dimension B (Sitting):                 72% (was 80%)

                                           (was 64% — DECLINED 6%)

    * Note: Scoring rounded across dimensions; functional total = 58%

  GMFCS Level:                             Level III (uses walker)

  Pediatric Balance Scale:                 18/56 (was 24 — DECLINED)

  Timed Up and Go (with walker):           34.7 sec (was 22.1 — WORSENED)

  6-Minute Walk Test (with walker):        64 meters (was 118 — DECLINED 46%)

CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:
  - Severe truncal ataxia — cannot maintain sitting without back support
    for >2 minutes
  - Intention tremor: bilateral, moderate-severe, interferes with all
    reaching activities
  - Myoclonic jerks: observed 5 times during 45-minute session (increased
    frequency from November)
  - Dysarthria: the few words Eli speaks are now slurred and effortful
  - Swallowing: mother reports occasional coughing with thin liquids
    (NEW — recommend swallow evaluation)
  - Drooling: intermittent (NEW)
  - Eye movements: I am noting jerky, irregular eye movements when Eli
    tracks a visual target — possible nystagmus (outside my scope to
    diagnose but documenting observation)

THERAPIST ASSESSMENT:
Eli has declined by 10 GMFM-88 percentage points in 6 months of therapy
(68% → 58%). All standardized measures show accelerating regression. He
has transitioned from GMFCS Level II to Level III. At the current rate of
decline, he will likely be non-ambulatory within 6–12 months.

I am now formally documenting my professional opinion that this child's
motor presentation is NOT CONSISTENT WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER and
that a progressive neurodegenerative condition must be ruled out. I will
be writing a formal letter to the referring providers (see Record 7.4).

REVISED GOALS (next 8 weeks):
1. Maintain wheelchair-level functional mobility
2. Maintain supported sitting for 10 minutes for meals/school activities
3. Safe transfers: sit-to-stand with walker, wheelchair transfers
4. UE function: maintain ability to self-feed with adapted utensils
5. Caregiver training: safe transfers, positioning, skin integrity

PLAN:
  Continue PT 2x/week, maintenance focus. Requesting wheelchair seating
  clinic evaluation for positioning optimization. Recommend referral for:
    - Speech-language pathology (swallowing evaluation)
    - Ophthalmology (abnormal eye movements)
    - NEUROLOGY — URGENT

RE:     Eli Reeves, DOB 03/15/2012, MRN NCH-2019-77432
        URGENT: REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED NEUROLOGICAL EVALUATION

Dear Dr. Huang, Dr. Okafor, and Dr. Osei:

I am writing this formal letter of clinical concern regarding my patient,
Eli Reeves, whom I have been treating in outpatient physical therapy since
August 12, 2019. I have now seen Eli for 36 sessions over approximately
7 months, and I am compelled to formally document my observations and
professional concerns.

SUMMARY OF MOTOR DECLINE:
Since initiating physical therapy, Eli has demonstrated CONTINUOUS AND
ACCELERATING motor regression despite consistent, intensive intervention
(2x/week, 45-minute sessions, 94% attendance rate). His standardized
assessment scores are as follows:

  GMFM-88 Total Score:
    August 2019 (Initial):     68%
    November 2019 (3 months):  64%  (decline of 4%)
    February 2020 (6 months):  58%  (decline of 10% total)

  GMFCS Level:
    August 2019:               Level II (walks with limitations)
    February 2020:             Level III (walks with handheld device)

  Pediatric Balance Scale:
    August 2019:               28/56
    February 2020:             18/56

  6-Minute Walk Test:
    August 2019:               142 meters
    February 2020:              64 meters (55% decline)

  Timed Up and Go:
    August 2019:               18.4 seconds
    February 2020:             34.7 seconds (89% slower)

  Equipment Progression:
    August 2019:               Independent ambulation (with falls)
    September 2019:            Bilateral AFOs prescribed
    November 2019:             Posterior walker introduced
    January 2020:              Wheelchair obtained

THIS PATTERN OF DECLINE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER.

In my 14 years of clinical practice in pediatric neurological rehabilitation,
I have treated hundreds of children with ASD. Children with ASD may have
motor clumsiness, hypotonia, motor planning difficulties, and coordination
deficits. However, these features are STATIC or SLOWLY IMPROVING with
intervention — they do NOT progressively worsen. The motor profile I am
observing in Eli is characteristic of a PROGRESSIVE NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION,
specifically one affecting cerebellar and upper motor neuron pathways.

SPECIFIC CLINICAL FINDINGS INCONSISTENT WITH ASD:

1. CEREBELLAR SIGNS: Eli demonstrates a textbook cerebellar syndrome
   including progressive ataxia (truncal and appendicular), dysmetria,
   dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, and what appears to be nystagmus.
   These findings are NOT features of ASD. They are features of cerebellar
   degeneration.

2. UPPER MOTOR NEURON SIGNS: Eli has brisk deep tendon reflexes (3+),
   ankle clonus (now 4–5 beats), and mildly increased tone in the lower
   extremities. These suggest corticospinal tract involvement. ASD does
   not cause upper motor neuron signs.

3. MYOCLONUS: I have directly observed myoclonic jerks during therapy
   sessions, increasing in frequency from 3 per session in November to
   5 per session in February. Mother reports nightly myoclonic jerks
   during sleep. This suggests a seizure disorder or progressive
   myoclonic condition.

4. REGRESSION: Eli is LOSING previously acquired motor skills. He could
   ride a tricycle at age 4 and cannot now. He could write his name at
   age 6 and cannot now. He was walking independently at age 7 and now
   requires a walker. Children with ASD do not lose gross motor milestones
   in this pattern.

5. SPEECH REGRESSION: Although speech is outside my primary scope, I note
   that Eli's verbal output has declined from short sentences to
   approximately 10 single words, with emerging dysarthria. Speech
   regression in a child over age 3 should prompt investigation for
   neurological disease.

6. NEW BULBAR SIGNS: Mother reports coughing with thin liquids and I have
   observed intermittent drooling — these suggest emerging dysphagia and
   are NOT features of ASD.

DIFFERENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS (for the treating physicians):
While diagnosis is outside my scope of practice, the combination of
progressive cerebellar ataxia, upper motor neuron signs, myoclonus, speech
regression, and possible seizures in a school-age child is a recognizable
clinical pattern. I would respectfully suggest that the following conditions
be considered in the neurological workup:
  - Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)
  - Juvenile-onset leukodystrophy
  - Mitochondrial disease
  - Ataxia-telangiectasia
  - Wilson disease
  - Progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndrome

REQUEST:
I am formally requesting that Eli's upcoming neurology appointment (currently
scheduled for March 2021 — ONE FULL YEAR from now) be EXPEDITED to the
earliest possible date. This child is deteriorating rapidly. Based on the
trajectory of his decline, he will likely be non-ambulatory within 6 months
and may require gastrostomy tube feeding if dysphagia progresses.

I am also requesting that this letter be placed in Eli's medical record and
that I receive confirmation of receipt from all addressees.

I remain available to discuss my findings with any member of Eli's care team
at any time. I can be reached directly at (614) 722-6200 ext. 4418 or by
email at sarah.lindgren@nationwidechildrens.org.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

RECORD 7.5 — PT DISCHARGE SUMMARY
Date of Service:    September 13, 2021
Patient Age:        9 years, 6 months
Visit Type:         PT Discharge Summary
Total Sessions:     87 (over 25 months, including COVID-19 interruption)
ICD-10:             R26.0 (Ataxic gait)
                    R27.0 (Ataxia, unspecified)

                    E75.4 (Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis — NEW)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DISCHARGE REASON:
Eli is being discharged from outpatient PT and transitioned to home-based
PT services through Medicaid waiver. He is no longer able to safely
participate in outpatient sessions due to severity of motor impairment,
seizure frequency, and transportation challenges. He was recently
diagnosed with a progressive neurodegenerative condition (neuronal ceroid
lipofuscinosis — see Neurology records, Dr. Osei) which confirms the
concerns I have documented throughout his course of treatment.

SUMMARY OF TREATMENT COURSE:
  Duration:           August 2019 — September 2021 (25 months)
  Sessions attended:  87 of 94 scheduled (93% attendance)
  COVID interruption: March 2020 — June 2020 (telehealth only, limited)
                      In-person resumed July 2020

FUNCTIONAL TRAJECTORY (GMFM-88 scores):
  August 2019:        68%  | GMFCS Level II
  November 2019:      64%  | GMFCS Level II–III
  February 2020:      58%  | GMFCS Level III
  July 2020:          48%  | GMFCS Level III–IV  (post-COVID gap)
  January 2021:       38%  | GMFCS Level IV
  September 2021:     22%  | GMFCS Level IV–V

CURRENT FUNCTIONAL STATUS AT DISCHARGE:
  - Non-ambulatory — full-time wheelchair user (tilt-in-space manual chair)
  - Requires moderate-maximum assist for all transfers
  - Sitting balance: poor — requires lateral trunk supports in wheelchair
  - Unable to maintain floor sitting without support
  - Upper extremity function: severely impaired by intention tremor and
    myoclonus — unable to self-feed, requires full assist for ADLs
  - Verbal output: <5 words, severely dysarthric
  - Using eye-gaze AAC device (obtained June 2021)
  - G-tube placed August 2021 due to progressive dysphagia
  - Seizures: generalized tonic-clonic 2–3x/month, myoclonic daily
    (on medication — levetiracetam and clobazam)

EQUIPMENT IN PLACE AT DISCHARGE:
  - Zippie tilt-in-space manual wheelchair with custom seating
  - Bilateral AFOs (for positioning, no longer for ambulation)
  - TLSO brace (scoliosis now 34 degrees per last orthopedic visit)
  - Stander (EasyStand Bantam, for weight-bearing 30 min/day)
  - Hospital bed with side rails
  - Hoyer lift (obtained September 2021)
  - Eye-gaze AAC device (Tobii Dynavox I-15)

THERAPIST FINAL COMMENTS:
I have treated Eli Reeves for over two years. During that time, I watched
a child who walked into my clinic under his own power become wheelchair-
dependent and nearly fully reliant on caregivers for all activities of
daily living. I documented my concerns about a progressive neurological
condition in August 2019, reiterated them in November 2019, formalized
them in a letter in March 2020, and they were ultimately confirmed by
Dr. Osei's diagnosis in mid-2021.

I want to note for the record that the diagnosis of ASD — while possibly
a comorbid condition — functioned as a "diagnostic overshadowing" that
delayed recognition of Eli's progressive neurological disease by years.
The signs were present and worsening throughout his time in my care.
Multiple providers, including Dr. Okafor and myself, documented concern
and requested expedited neurology evaluation. Systemic delays (wait times,
the COVID-19 pandemic) contributed to the diagnostic delay.

I wish Eli and his family the very best. He is a sweet child who tried
his hardest in every session. His mother is a fierce advocate who never
stopped searching for answers.

HOME-BASED PT RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - PT 2x/week in home for positioning, ROM, caregiver training
  - Focus: contracture prevention, skin integrity, respiratory function
  - Standing program: 30 min/day in stander for bone health

                    *** NEW PATIENT CONSULTATION ***
                    *** EXTENDED VISIT — 90 MINUTES ***

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
9-year-old male with existing diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder referred
for evaluation of progressive motor regression, suspected seizures, and
speech regression. Multiple providers (orthopedics, physical therapy) have
documented concern that the patient's clinical trajectory is inconsistent
with ASD and suggestive of a progressive neurological condition. Referral
initially placed November 2019; delayed by COVID-19 pandemic.

I have reviewed the following records prior to this visit:
  - Dr. Patricia Huang (PCP) — records from 2015–2021
  - Dr. Robert Yuen (Developmental Pediatrics) — ASD evaluation, 2015
  - Dr. Michael Okafor (Orthopedics) — records from 2019–2020
  - Sarah Lindgren, DPT (PT) — evaluation and progress notes 2019–2020,
    INCLUDING her formal letter of concern dated March 4, 2020
  - Columbus Children's Academy — IEP documents, 2018–2020
  - Nationwide Children's ED visit, January 22, 2020

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Eli is a 9-year-old mixed-race (Black/White) male who presents with his
mother, Danielle Reeves, for evaluation of a progressive neurological
decline that has been ongoing for approximately 4–5 years.

DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY (reviewed in detail with mother):
  Prenatal:       Uncomplicated pregnancy, prenatal care initiated at 8 weeks
  Birth:          Full term (39w2d), SVD, birth weight 7 lbs 4 oz, Apgar 8/9
  Newborn:        Unremarkable nursery course, discharged day 2

  Motor milestones:
    Sat independently:   6 months (normal)
    Crawled:             9 months (normal)
    Pulled to stand:     11 months (normal)
    Walked independently: 15 months (mildly delayed)
    Ran:                  22 months (normal)
    Rode tricycle:        age 4 (normal)

  Language milestones:
    Babbled:              8 months (normal)
    First words:          14 months (normal)
    2-word phrases:       24 months (normal)
    Short sentences:      age 3 (normal for lower end)

  *** KEY OBSERVATION: This child's early developmental trajectory was
  essentially NORMAL through at least age 3. Motor milestones were
  achieved on time or near-normal. Language milestones were achieved.
  This is CRITICAL — a child with a neurodegenerative disease may have
  a period of normal development before the onset of regression. ***

TIMELINE OF REGRESSION (constructed from parent report and medical records):
  Age 3 (2015):    ASD diagnosed. Concerns at this time were primarily
                    behavioral (limited eye contact, restricted interests,
                    repetitive behaviors). Motor exam was reportedly normal
                    aside from "mild clumsiness."

  Age 4–5 (2016–2017): Mother began noticing increasing clumsiness.
                    Falls became more frequent. Speech plateaued, then
                    began to shorten. Teachers noted difficulty with
                    previously mastered tasks (cutting with scissors,
                    coloring within lines).

  Age 5–6 (2017–2018): Falls 2–3 times daily. Unable to ride tricycle
                    (previously could). Handwriting deteriorating.
                    Staring episodes began — initially attributed to
                    "ASD zoning out."

  Age 6–7 (2018–2019): Falls 3–4 times daily. Speech reduced to short
                    phrases. Staring episodes 2–3/day. Sleep myoclonus
                    began. Mother describes hand tremor when reaching.

  Age 7–8 (2019–2020): AFOs prescribed. Posterior walker. Wheelchair
                    obtained. GMFM declined 68%→58%. PT documents
                    cerebellar signs, UMN signs, myoclonus. PT writes
                    formal letter of concern (March 2020).

  Age 8–9 (2020–2021): Became non-ambulatory. Speech declined to ~5
                    words. G-tube placed for progressive dysphagia.
                    Seizure activity increasing (mother describes
                    2–3 episodes per month of whole-body stiffening
                    followed by jerking, lasting 1–3 minutes).

FAMILY HISTORY (three-generation pedigree obtained):
  Mother (Danielle Reeves, age 35): healthy, African American
  Father (Marcus Reeves, age 37): healthy, Caucasian
  No siblings
  Maternal grandmother: type 2 diabetes, hypertension — alive, age 62
  Maternal grandfather: deceased age 58, MI
  Paternal grandmother: alive, age 65, healthy
  Paternal grandfather: alive, age 68, mild cognitive decline (dementia?)
  No known family history of:
    - Childhood neurological disease
    - Seizure disorders
    - Developmental regression
    - Consanguinity
    - Early childhood death

  *** Note: NCL can be autosomal recessive. Both parents could be
  carriers without family history. The mixed-race background does not
  reduce risk — NCL occurs across all ethnic groups. ***

MEDICATIONS:
  - Melatonin 5 mg QHS
  - Miralax 17 g daily (constipation)

ALLERGIES: NKDA

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

  Vitals:
    Height:         126.3 cm (5th percentile — continued decline)
    Weight:          22.1 kg (3rd percentile — continued decline)
    BMI:             13.8 (8th percentile)
    HR:              92 bpm
    RR:              20
    BP:              98/62
    Temp:            36.8°C
    SpO2:            97% RA

  General: Thin male in tilt-in-space wheelchair with lateral trunk
           supports. No verbal greeting. Eyes open, appears to track
           examiner briefly. Intermittent myoclonic jerks of bilateral
           upper extremities observed during the examination (counted
           7 episodes in 90 minutes). Mother assists with all positioning.

  HEENT:
    - Head: normocephalic, atraumatic
    - Eyes: Fundoscopic exam — *** BILATERAL MACULAR CHANGES noted.
      There is a subtle but definite orange-brown discoloration of the
      maculae bilaterally with surrounding retinal pallor. This is
      suggestive of lipofuscin accumulation and is concerning for
      neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Formal ophthalmology evaluation
      ordered. ***
    - Pupils: 3mm bilaterally, reactive to light, sluggish response
    - Extraocular movements: saccadic pursuit bilaterally, gaze-evoked
      horizontal nystagmus present
    - Ears: TMs clear bilaterally
    - Oropharynx: drooling noted, weak gag reflex on right, palate
      elevates symmetrically

  Cardiovascular: RRR, no murmur
  Respiratory: Clear bilaterally, no distress
  Abdomen: G-tube site clean, no erythema. Soft, non-distended.
  Skin: No neurocutaneous stigmata. No rash.

  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION (DETAILED):

    Mental Status:
      - Alert, eyes open, intermittent visual tracking
      - No verbal output during examination
      - Does not follow verbal commands consistently
      - Reached for mother's hand when distressed (purposeful movement)
      - No appropriate use of AAC device during exam (per mother, he
        can use it at home with prompting)
      - *** Formal cognitive assessment not possible due to motor and
        communication limitations. However, the degree of cognitive
        decline described by mother (he was conversational at age 5,
        could recognize letters and numbers) represents PROFOUND
        cognitive regression. ***

    Cranial Nerves:
      I:    Not tested
      II:   Bilateral macular changes as above. Visual acuity not
            formally testable — appears to have reduced central vision.
            Visual tracking present but inconsistent.
      III, IV, VI: Saccadic smooth pursuit. Gaze-evoked nystagmus
            (horizontal, bilateral). No ptosis. Pupils reactive but
            sluggish.
      V:    Facial sensation grossly intact (withdraws to light touch)
      VII:  Mild bilateral facial weakness — reduced nasolabial folds,
            incomplete eye closure bilaterally
      VIII: Appears to respond to sound and voice. Formal audiometry
            recommended.
      IX, X: Weak gag on right. Dysphonia. Dysphagia (G-tube dependent).
      XI:   Cannot assess volitionally. SCM bulk appears reduced.
      XII:  Tongue midline, movements slow, mild atrophy of tongue
            margins

    Motor:
      - Tone: MIXED PATTERN
        Upper extremities: hypotonic proximally, mildly increased
        distally (Modified Ashworth 1+ at wrists)
        Lower extremities: spastic, Modified Ashworth 2 at ankles,
        1+ at knees
      - Bulk: diffuse muscle wasting, most prominent in distal LE
        and intrinsic hand muscles
      - Strength (estimated, limited by cooperation):
        Deltoids: 3/5 bilaterally
        Biceps: 3+/5 bilaterally
        Wrist extensors: 3/5 bilaterally
        Grip: 2+/5 bilaterally
        Hip flexors: 2+/5 bilaterally

      Babinski:   POSITIVE bilaterally (upgoing toes)
      Hoffman:    POSITIVE bilaterally

    Coordination:
      - Finger-to-nose: severe dysmetria bilaterally — misses target
        by 5+ cm, with marked intention tremor
      - Rapid alternating movements: unable to perform
      - Heel-to-shin: unable to perform (cannot lift leg against gravity)

    Sensory:
      - Withdraws to pinprick in all extremities (grossly intact)
      - Proprioception: unable to assess volitionally

    Gait:
      - Non-ambulatory. Unable to stand even with maximum assist.
      - Unable to bear weight through lower extremities.

    Spine:
      - Visible thoracic scoliosis, convex right
      - Wearing TLSO brace

DURING THE EXAMINATION:
At approximately 45 minutes into the visit, Eli had a clinical seizure
event. His eyes deviated upward and to the left, bilateral upper
extremities extended and stiffened, followed by rhythmic jerking of all
four extremities lasting approximately 90 seconds. He became cyanotic
around the lips. Post-ictally, he was unresponsive for approximately
4 minutes, then gradually returned to his baseline. SpO2 nadir: 89%.
Mother states this is typical of his seizures and occurs 2–3 times per
month. No rescue medication was administered as the seizure self-resolved
within 2 minutes.

*** THIS IS AN UNPROVOKED GENERALIZED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE WITNESSED
BY A PHYSICIAN. This child has an active seizure disorder that has
NEVER BEEN EVALUATED with EEG. ***

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:

This is a 9-year-old male with a PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE
that has been misattributed to autism spectrum disorder for approximately
6 years. I want to state clearly and unequivocally:

*** THIS CHILD'S CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS NOT AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. ***

While Eli may have had some features consistent with ASD (restricted
interests, repetitive behaviors) in early childhood — and ASD may be a
comorbid condition — the DOMINANT clinical picture is one of a progressive
neurodegenerative disease characterized by:
  1. Progressive cerebellar ataxia (truncal and appendicular)
  2. Progressive spasticity (upper motor neuron involvement)
  3. Progressive cognitive decline (dementia)
  4. Progressive speech loss (aphasia and dysarthria)
  5. Seizures (generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic)
  6. Progressive dysphagia
  7. Macular changes on fundoscopy
  8. Visual decline

This constellation — particularly the combination of progressive dementia,
seizures, motor regression, myoclonus, and MACULAR CHANGES — is highly
suggestive of NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS (Batten disease), most likely
the late-infantile or juvenile form (CLN2 or CLN3).

The macular changes I observed on fundoscopy today are characteristic of
lipofuscin accumulation in retinal neurons and are a hallmark of NCL.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
  1. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 or CLN3) — HIGHEST SUSPICION
  2. Juvenile-onset GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs variant)
  3. Mitochondrial disease (MERRF, MELAS)
  4. Niemann-Pick type C
  5. Wilson disease (less likely given age of onset)
  6. Juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy

PLAN:
  1. URGENT EEG — 24-hour ambulatory EEG with video monitoring. Scheduled
     for April 5–6, 2021. Expecting to see generalized spike-and-wave
     discharges, possible photoparoxysmal response, background slowing.
  2. URGENT MRI Brain with and without contrast — with specific attention
     to cerebellar volume, white matter signal, cortical atrophy.
     Comparison with any prior imaging. Scheduled April 7, 2021.
  3. Laboratory workup:
     - CBC, CMP, hepatic function panel
     - Lactate, pyruvate (mitochondrial screen)
     - Ceruloplasmin, serum copper (Wilson disease screen)
     - Urine organic acids
     - Plasma amino acids
     - Lysosomal enzyme panel (including TPP1/CLN2 enzyme activity)
     - Acylcarnitine profile
     - Very long chain fatty acids
  4. Ophthalmology referral — URGENT — for formal retinal examination,
     OCT, electroretinography (ERG).
  5. Genetics referral — for genetic counseling and anticipated genetic
     testing (NCL gene panel or whole exome sequencing).
  6. Initiate anti-seizure medication: LEVETIRACETAM (Keppra) 250 mg
     PO BID, titrate to 500 mg BID over 2 weeks. Mother educated on
     medication, side effects, and seizure action plan.
  7. Follow-up in my clinic after EEG and MRI results are available —
     tentatively scheduled June 2021.
  8. Mother is understandably distressed. She has been telling providers
     for years that "something more is going on." She is correct. I spent
     30 minutes counseling her on what we are investigating, what the
     possible diagnoses mean, and what the next steps are. I provided her
     with written information about NCL and the Batten Disease Support
     and Research Association (BDSRA) website. Social work consult placed.

Time spent: 90 minutes face-to-face, 45 minutes chart review and
documentation. Total: 135 minutes. >50% counseling and coordination.

              ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY REPORT

CLINICAL INDICATION:
Progressive neurodevelopmental regression with witnessed generalized
tonic-clonic seizures and myoclonus. Evaluate for seizure type, epilepsy
syndrome classification, and background abnormalities consistent with
neurodegenerative disease.

TECHNICAL PARAMETERS:
  Recording type:       Continuous video-EEG monitoring
  Duration:             23 hours, 47 minutes
  Electrode placement:  International 10-20 system, 21 scalp electrodes
  Additional:           EKG channel, bilateral EMG (deltoid)
  Montages:             Bipolar (longitudinal, transverse), referential
  Activation procedures: Hyperventilation (not performed — patient unable
                         to cooperate), photic stimulation at 1–30 Hz
  Medications:          Levetiracetam 250 mg BID (started 03/08/2021,
                         titrating — subtherapeutic dose)
  Clinical state:       Awake, drowsy, Stage I, Stage II, Stage III sleep
                         recorded

BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:
  Awake state:
    - Posterior dominant rhythm: 5–6 Hz theta activity over occipital
      regions. This is MARKEDLY SLOW for age (expected: 9–10 Hz alpha).
    - No well-formed alpha rhythm identifiable.
    - Diffuse excess theta (4–7 Hz) activity throughout recording.
    - Intermittent bursts of diffuse delta (1–3 Hz) activity, maximal
      over frontal regions, occurring in runs of 2–5 seconds.
    - Background is POORLY ORGANIZED and DIFFUSELY SLOW, consistent with
      moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

  Sleep state:
    - Sleep architecture is DISORGANIZED.
    - Sleep spindles: present but poorly formed and reduced in amplitude.
    - K-complexes: present.
    - Vertex waves: present but low amplitude.
    - Slow-wave sleep achieved but with persistent epileptiform activity
      (see below).

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

  1. GENERALIZED SPIKE-AND-WAVE DISCHARGES:
     - Frequency: 2–2.5 Hz generalized spike-and-slow-wave complexes
     - Distribution: bilateral, synchronous, maximum amplitude frontally
     - Occurrence: 47 discrete bursts recorded during 24-hour monitoring
     - Duration: bursts lasting 1.5–8 seconds
     - *** Several bursts at 2 Hz with duration >3 seconds are associated
       with behavioral arrest (staring, cessation of movement) on video —
       these represent ABSENCE SEIZURES ***

  2. GENERALIZED POLYSPIKE-AND-WAVE:
     - Generalized polyspike-and-wave discharges at 3–4 Hz
     - Occur primarily during drowsiness and light sleep
     - 12 discrete bursts recorded
     - Associated with myoclonic jerks visible on video and confirmed
       on EMG channels

  3. MULTIFOCAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES:
     - Independent sharp waves and spikes arising from:
       * Left temporal (T3/T5): 34 discharges
       * Right temporal (T4/T6): 28 discharges
       * Left frontal (F3/F7): 18 discharges
       * Right occipital (O2): 14 discharges
     - Multifocal distribution suggests widespread cortical dysfunction

  4. PHOTOPAROXYSMAL RESPONSE:
     - During photic stimulation, a ROBUST photoparoxysmal response was
       elicited at flash frequencies of 8–18 Hz.
     - Response: generalized spike-and-wave discharge with associated
       myoclonic jerk
     - *** Photoparoxysmal response is a characteristic finding in
       neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and progressive myoclonic
       epilepsies ***

  5. SLEEP-ACTIVATED EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
     - Marked increase in epileptiform discharges during NREM sleep
     - Near-continuous spike-and-wave activity during Stage II sleep
       (electrical status epilepticus in sleep — ESES pattern)
     - This pattern is associated with progressive cognitive decline

CLINICAL EVENTS CAPTURED:

  Event 1 (04/05/2021, 14:32):
    Clinical: Patient stares, ceases hand movement, unresponsive x 6 sec
    EEG: 2 Hz generalized spike-and-wave, 6 seconds
    Classification: ABSENCE SEIZURE

  Event 2 (04/05/2021, 19:47):
    Clinical: Sudden bilateral arm jerk, drops toy
    EEG: Generalized polyspike, single discharge
    Classification: MYOCLONIC SEIZURE

  Event 3 (04/05/2021, 22:15 — asleep):
    Clinical: Bilateral arm and leg jerks, rhythmic, x 4 seconds
    EEG: Generalized polyspike-and-wave burst, 4 seconds
    Classification: MYOCLONIC SEIZURE (sleep)

  Event 4 (04/06/2021, 03:22 — asleep):
    Clinical: Eyes open, tonic stiffening bilateral UE, evolves to
    bilateral rhythmic jerking x 75 seconds. Desaturation to 91%.
    Postictal unresponsiveness x 3 minutes.
    EEG: Generalized fast activity → generalized rhythmic spike-and-wave
    at 3 Hz → gradual slowing → postictal suppression
    Classification: GENERALIZED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE

  Events 5–11: Multiple additional myoclonic events (7 total) and
  absence events (2 additional) recorded throughout monitoring.

TOTAL SEIZURES CAPTURED: 11 seizures in 24 hours
  - 3 absence seizures
  - 7 myoclonic seizures
  - 1 generalized tonic-clonic seizure

IMPRESSION:
1. MARKEDLY ABNORMAL 24-HOUR VIDEO EEG.

2. Severe diffuse background slowing (5–6 Hz) consistent with moderate-
   to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction / encephalopathy. This degree
   of slowing in a 9-year-old is highly abnormal.

3. Multiple seizure types captured: absence, myoclonic, and generalized
   tonic-clonic — indicating a GENERALIZED EPILEPSY SYNDROME.

4. Multifocal epileptiform discharges indicating widespread cortical
   hyperexcitability.

5. Robust photoparoxysmal response — characteristic of progressive
   myoclonic epilepsy / neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

6. Near-continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ESES pattern) —
   likely contributing to progressive cognitive decline.

7. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The combination of progressive dementia,
   multiple seizure types (including myoclonic and absence), background
   slowing, photoparoxysmal response, and ESES pattern is HIGHLY
   CONSISTENT with a progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndrome, most
   likely NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS given the clinical context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - Optimize anti-seizure medication — current levetiracetam dose is
    subtherapeutic. Recommend uptitration and consideration of adding
    clobazam for myoclonic seizures.
  - AVOID valproic acid until mitochondrial disease is excluded.
  - AVOID carbamazepine/phenytoin — may worsen myoclonic seizures.
  - Repeat EEG in 3–6 months to assess treatment response and
    disease progression.

              MRI BRAIN — DIAGNOSTIC REPORT

CLINICAL INDICATION:
Progressive neurodegenerative condition with seizures, motor regression,
cognitive decline. Concern for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Evaluate
for cerebellar atrophy, cortical atrophy, white matter changes.

TECHNIQUE:
MRI of the brain performed on 3T Siemens Prisma scanner. Sequences:
  - Sagittal T1-weighted (pre- and post-contrast)
  - Axial T1-weighted (pre- and post-contrast)
  - Axial T2-weighted
  - Axial FLAIR
  - Axial DWI/ADC
  - Axial SWI (susceptibility-weighted imaging)
  - Coronal T2-weighted (high resolution, hippocampal protocol)
  - 3D volumetric T1 (for volumetric analysis)
  - MR spectroscopy (single voxel, cerebellar vermis and left basal ganglia)

Gadolinium contrast: Gadavist 0.1 mmol/kg IV, 2.2 mL administered.
Sedation: General anesthesia (propofol/sevoflurane) per anesthesia team.

COMPARISON:
No prior brain MRI available for direct comparison. Per records, no
neuroimaging has been performed previously.

*** NOTE: The absence of any prior brain MRI in a child with a 6-year
history of developmental concerns, progressive motor decline, and seizures
represents a significant gap in the diagnostic workup. ***

FINDINGS:

  Cerebral Cortex:
    - Diffuse cortical volume loss, most pronounced in the occipital and
      parietal regions. Sulci are widened globally.
    - The degree of cortical atrophy is MARKEDLY ABNORMAL for a 9-year-old
      and is consistent with a neurodegenerative process.
    - Cortical thinning is most severe in the visual cortex (calcarine
      region) and posterior parietal cortex.
    - No focal cortical lesion or malformation.

  White Matter:
    - Diffuse T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter,
      extending into the corona radiata bilaterally.
    - Confluent T2 signal abnormality in the posterior periventricular
      regions and posterior corpus callosum (splenium).
    - The white matter volume is reduced, with prominent ventriculomegaly
      that is EX VACUO (secondary to parenchymal loss rather than
      hydrocephalus).
    - These findings suggest both demyelination and gliosis.

  Cerebellum:
    - *** SEVERE CEREBELLAR ATROPHY — this is the most striking finding
      on this study. ***
    - Cerebellar hemispheric volume is markedly reduced bilaterally.
    - Prominent widening of the cerebellar fissures.
    - Vermian atrophy with widening of the primary and secondary fissures.
    - The cerebellar volume loss is DISPROPORTIONATE to the cerebral
      atrophy, suggesting a process with particular predilection for the
      cerebellum.
    - 3D volumetric analysis: Cerebellar volume measures approximately
      92 cm³ (expected for age/sex: ~135–145 cm³) — representing
      approximately 35% volume loss.
    - Cerebellar cortex shows abnormal T2 hyperintensity, suggesting
      active degeneration.

  Brainstem:
    - Mild volume loss of the pons.
    - Thinning of the middle cerebellar peduncles bilaterally.
    - Medulla appears relatively preserved.

  Deep Gray Matter:
    - Thalami: mildly reduced in volume bilaterally. T2 signal is mildly
      increased, particularly in the pulvinar regions bilaterally.
      *** Thalamic signal change with pulvinar predominance can be seen
      in certain forms of NCL. ***
    - Basal ganglia: globus pallidus and putamen appear mildly small.
      No abnormal signal. No calcification on SWI.
    - Caudate nuclei: mildly atrophic.

  Ventricles:
    - Lateral ventricles: moderately enlarged (ex vacuo).
    - Third ventricle: mildly enlarged.
    - Fourth ventricle: prominent, reflecting cerebellar atrophy.
    - No obstructive hydrocephalus.
    - No periventricular edema.

  Hippocampi:
    - Bilateral hippocampal volume loss. Temporal horns mildly prominent.
    - No mesial temporal sclerosis.

  Post-Contrast:
    - No abnormal parenchymal enhancement.
    - No leptomeningeal enhancement.
    - No mass lesion.

  MR Spectroscopy:
    Cerebellar vermis:
      - Decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak — indicating neuronal
        loss/dysfunction
      - Elevated myoinositol (mI) — indicating gliosis
      - NAA/Cr ratio: 1.1 (normal >1.6 for age) — MARKEDLY REDUCED
      - Choline/Cr ratio: mildly elevated — suggesting membrane turnover
      - No lactate peak identified in this voxel

    Left basal ganglia:
      - Mildly decreased NAA
      - NAA/Cr ratio: 1.4 (low-normal)
      - Small lactate doublet detected at 1.3 ppm — *** ABNORMAL,
        suggesting impaired mitochondrial function ***

  Other:
    - Orbits: optic nerves appear mildly thin bilaterally (volume loss)
    - No extra-axial collection
    - Calvarium: normal
    - Paranasal sinuses: mild mucosal thickening in maxillary sinuses

IMPRESSION:
1. MARKEDLY ABNORMAL MRI demonstrating a pattern of PROGRESSIVE
   NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE in a 9-year-old male.

2. SEVERE CEREBELLAR ATROPHY — disproportionate to cerebral atrophy,
   with estimated 35% volume loss. Cerebellar cortex shows signal
   change suggesting active degeneration. This correlates with the
   patient's progressive ataxia.

3. DIFFUSE CEREBRAL CORTICAL ATROPHY with occipital-parietal predominance.
   Cortical thinning is most severe in the visual cortex, correlating
   with the patient's visual decline.

4. DIFFUSE WHITE MATTER SIGNAL ABNORMALITY — periventricular and posterior
   predominant, consistent with demyelination/gliosis.

5. Ex vacuo ventriculomegaly secondary to parenchymal volume loss.

6. Thalamic signal change (pulvinar regions) — can be associated with
   neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

7. MR spectroscopy: Decreased NAA in cerebellum (neuronal loss), elevated
   myoinositol (gliosis), and small lactate peak in basal ganglia
   (possible mitochondrial dysfunction).

8. OVERALL PATTERN: The combination of progressive cerebellar atrophy,
   cortical atrophy (occipital predominant), white matter changes, and
   thalamic signal abnormality is CONSISTENT WITH NEURONAL CEROID
   LIPOFUSCINOSIS. The cerebellar predominance of the atrophy may
   suggest CLN2 (late-infantile) form, though overlap between subtypes
   exists.

9. Given the absence of prior imaging, it is not possible to document
   the rate of progression radiographically. Recommend follow-up MRI
   in 12 months for comparison.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS WITH FAMILY:

I spent 45 minutes reviewing each piece of evidence with both parents:

  1. EEG: I explained that Eli's EEG showed multiple types of seizures
     (11 in 24 hours), severe background slowing indicating widespread
     brain dysfunction, and a photoparoxysmal response that is
     characteristic of NCL. His staring episodes are absence seizures.
     His sleep jerking consists of myoclonic seizures. The episodes of
     body stiffening and jerking are generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

  2. MRI: I showed both parents the MRI images on my screen. I pointed
     out the severe cerebellar atrophy (35% volume loss) and the diffuse
     cortical atrophy. I compared Eli's scan to a normal 9-year-old
     brain image. Mother gasped. Father was silent.

  3. Labs: I explained that the TPP1 enzyme level of 0.8 (normal >5.0)
     confirms that Eli's body cannot produce sufficient amounts of the
     enzyme needed to break down certain cellular waste products
     (lipofuscins). These waste products accumulate in neurons, causing
     progressive neuronal death.

  4. Prognosis: This was the most difficult part of the conversation.
     I explained that CLN2 disease is a progressive, currently
     incurable condition. Typical life expectancy with CLN2 disease
     is 6–15 years from symptom onset, though some patients survive
     into their teens or early twenties with supportive care. I
     explained that Eli's symptoms likely began around age 4–5, which
     means he has been living with active disease for approximately
     4–5 years.

     I discussed the expected trajectory:
       - Continued loss of motor function → becoming fully dependent
       - Continued cognitive decline
       - Seizures may become more difficult to control
       - Progressive visual loss → likely blindness
       - Progressive dysphagia (G-tube already in place)
       - Respiratory complications in later stages

     Mother was crying. Father stood and left the room for several
     minutes. Social worker followed him. When he returned, he asked:
     "How did no one catch this sooner?"

  5. Treatment Options: I discussed the following:
     a) CERLIPONASE ALFA (Brineura) — FDA-approved enzyme replacement
        therapy for CLN2 disease, administered via intracerebroventricular
        infusion every 2 weeks. I explained that this treatment has been
        shown to slow the rate of motor and language decline in children
        treated EARLY in the disease course. However, I was honest with
        the family that Eli's disease is ADVANCED, and the benefit of
        initiating ERT at this stage is uncertain. I recommended
        referral to a CLN2 treatment center for evaluation.

     b) Ongoing seizure management with optimization of anti-seizure
        medications.

     c) Supportive/palliative care to maximize quality of life.

     d) Genetic testing of both parents (carrier testing) and genetic
        counseling for future family planning.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
  - Levetiracetam: increase to 500 mg PO BID (from 250 mg BID)
  - ADD: Clobazam (Onfi) 5 mg PO BID for myoclonic seizures
  - Continue melatonin 5 mg QHS
  - ADD: Diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) 10 mg PRN for seizures >5 minutes
    (emergency rescue medication). Mother and father trained on
    administration. School nurse to be trained as well.

  6. Franklin County Board of DD — Medicaid waiver application for
     home nursing, respite care, equipment needs
     — Social worker assisting family with application

UPDATED DIAGNOSIS LIST:
  1. CLN2 disease (late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) — E75.4
  2. Generalized epilepsy (absence, myoclonic, tonic-clonic seizures) —
     G40.409
  3. Progressive cerebellar ataxia — G11.1
  4. Neuromuscular scoliosis, thoracic (18→34 degrees) — M41.24
  5. Dysphagia, G-tube dependent — R13.10, Z93.1
  6. Dysarthria / expressive aphasia — R47.1
  7. Progressive visual impairment — H54.7
  8. Cognitive regression / dementia — F03.90
  9. Possible comorbid ASD (historical diagnosis) — F84.0
     *** Note: The original ASD diagnosis from age 3 may represent early
     manifestations of CLN2 disease rather than true autism spectrum
     disorder. The behavioral features that led to the ASD diagnosis
     (restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, social withdrawal) can
     be seen in the early stages of NCL as the brain begins to
     degenerate. I am listing ASD as a "possible comorbid" condition
     rather than removing it entirely, as I cannot retrospectively
     determine whether true ASD was present in addition to CLN2. ***

FOLLOW-UP:
  - Neurology: 3 months (September 2021)
  - Sooner if seizures worsen or new symptoms develop
  - Mother has my direct office number for urgent concerns

A NOTE ON DIAGNOSTIC DELAY:
For the medical record, I want to document the following timeline:
  - Age 3 (2015): ASD diagnosed. Motor exam "mildly clumsy."
  - Age 5 (2017): Mother raising concerns about worsening. Attributed
    to ASD.
  - Age 7 (2019): Orthopedic surgeon documents concern and recommends
    neurology re-evaluation. PT documents progressive cerebellar signs.
  - Age 7 (2019): Neurology referral placed (November 2019).
  - Age 8 (2020): PT writes formal letter requesting expedited evaluation.
    Appointment delayed by COVID-19 from June 2020 to March 2021.
  - Age 9 (2021): First neurology evaluation. Diagnosis confirmed.

The total time from first documented provider concern to diagnosis
was approximately 20 months (July 2019 to April 2021). The total time
from probable symptom onset to diagnosis was approximately 5–6 years
(age 4 to age 9). Earlier diagnosis — particularly if obtained before
age 6–7 — might have allowed for earlier initiation of cerliponase alfa
therapy, potentially preserving more neurological function.

I raise this not to assign blame, but to emphasize the importance of
maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in children with
developmental concerns, particularly when regression is present. The
diagnosis of ASD, once applied, created a framework through which ALL
subsequent symptoms were interpreted — a phenomenon known as "diagnostic
overshadowing." Progressive motor decline, seizures, and speech
regression were attributed to ASD or "just how he is" rather than
triggering re-evaluation of the underlying diagnosis.

Time spent: 60 minutes face-to-face, 30 minutes documentation.
>50% counseling and coordination.

              SECTION 3 — SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
              CRITICAL MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMPILED BY: Emergent Diagnostic Institution — Medical Records Analysis

SECTION 3 OVERVIEW:
This section covers the period from July 2019 to September 2021 (Eli ages
7–10), during which the true nature of Eli's condition finally came to light.
After years of progressive decline attributed to autism spectrum disorder,
three key events converged to break through the diagnostic overshadowing:
an orthopedic surgeon who recognized the atypicality of the motor findings,
a physical therapist who meticulously documented progressive decline and
wrote a landmark letter of concern, and a pediatric neurologist who — when
finally given the opportunity to evaluate Eli — immediately recognized the
neurodegenerative pattern.

PROVIDERS IN THIS SECTION:
  Provider 6: Dr. Michael Okafor, MD — Orthopedic Surgery (3 records)
  Provider 7: Sarah Lindgren, DPT — Physical Therapy (5 records)
  Provider 8: Dr. Amara Osei, MD, PhD — Pediatric Neurology (5 records)

     - October 2019: Cobb angle 14 degrees (+2 in 3 months)
     - March 2020: Cobb angle 18 degrees (+6 in 8 months)
     - September 2021: Cobb angle 34 degrees (per PT discharge note)
     - Reclassified from "idiopathic" to "neuromuscular" scoliosis

  2. MOTOR DECLINE TRAJECTORY (Physical Therapy — GMFM-88):

     - September 2019: Bilateral AFOs
     - November 2019: Posterior walker
     - January 2020: Wheelchair (manual, tilt-in-space)
     - September 2021: Hoyer lift, hospital bed, fully dependent

  4. COMMUNICATION DECLINE:
     - Age 7 (2019): Short 2–3 word phrases
     - Age 8 (2020): ~10–15 single words
     - Age 9 (2021): <5 words, severely dysarthric
     - Age 9 (2021): Eye-gaze AAC device

  5. DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (Neurology):
     - EEG: 11 seizures in 24 hours (absence, myoclonic, GTC); severe
       background slowing; photoparoxysmal response; ESES pattern
     - MRI: Severe cerebellar atrophy (35% volume loss), diffuse cortical
       atrophy (occipital predominant), white matter changes, thalamic
       signal abnormality
     - Labs: TPP1 enzyme 0.8 nmol/hr/mg (critically low, <5% normal);
       lactate 2.8 (elevated); ceruloplasmin/copper normal
     - DIAGNOSIS: CLN2 disease (late-infantile neuronal ceroid
       lipofuscinosis / Batten disease)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
              CRITICAL MISSED OPPORTUNITIES — TIMELINE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  OPPORTUNITY 1 (Age 3, 2015):
    What happened: ASD diagnosed based on behavioral features.
    What was missed: No neurological examination beyond basic screening.
                     No baseline brain MRI. No metabolic screening.
    What should have occurred: A more comprehensive differential diagnosis
    that included neurodegenerative conditions, particularly given the
    report of "mild clumsiness" that was already present.

  OPPORTUNITY 2 (Ages 4–5, 2016–2017):
    What happened: Mother reported increasing clumsiness, falls, and
    speech plateau. PCP attributed to ASD.
    What was missed: The transition from "clumsy" to "falling frequently"
    represents a RED FLAG for progressive disease. Loss of tricycle-riding
    ability (a previously mastered skill) is REGRESSION, not ASD.
    What should have occurred: Referral to pediatric neurology when motor
    regression was first reported.

  OPPORTUNITY 3 (Ages 5–6, 2017–2018):
    What happened: Staring episodes began. Attributed to "ASD zoning out."
    What was missed: Staring episodes in a child with developmental
    regression should be evaluated with EEG. Any child with new-onset
    staring spells deserves seizure evaluation.
    What should have occurred: EEG. If performed at this time, the
    characteristic NCL EEG pattern would likely have been present and
    could have led to diagnosis 3–4 years earlier.

  OPPORTUNITY 4 (Age 7, July 2019):
    What happened: Dr. Okafor (orthopedics) documented cerebellar signs,
    ataxia, and concern for progressive neurological condition. Recommended
    neurology re-evaluation.
    What was missed: The referral process was slow. No urgent pathway.
    What should have occurred: STAT neurology consultation. A child with
    documented cerebellar signs and progressive motor decline should be
    seen urgently, not placed on a 4–5 month waitlist.

  OPPORTUNITY 5 (Age 7, January 2020):
    What happened: Eli was seen in the Nationwide Children's ED after a
    witnessed seizure at school. Diagnosed as "seizure vs. behavioral
    staring spell in child with ASD." Discharged without EEG.
    What was missed: A witnessed tonic event in a child with progressive
    neurological decline was DISMISSED as possibly behavioral because of
    the ASD label. This is diagnostic overshadowing at its most dangerous.
    What should have occurred: Emergent or urgent EEG. Neurology consult
    from the ED. Admission for workup.

  OPPORTUNITY 6 (Age 8, March–June 2020):
    What happened: PT wrote a detailed, evidence-based letter requesting
    expedited neurology evaluation. COVID-19 pandemic delayed the
    appointment from June 2020 to March 2021.
    What was missed: Despite a compelling clinical case documented by
    PT and orthopedics, the system failed to expedite care even before
    COVID. The pandemic added 9 months to an already lengthy wait.
    What should have occurred: Telehealth neurology evaluation during
    COVID. Record review and remote assessment could have initiated the
    diagnostic workup months earlier.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMPACT OF DIAGNOSTIC DELAY:

CLN2 disease has an FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy (cerliponase
alfa / Brineura), which was approved in April 2017. Clinical trials have
demonstrated that early initiation of treatment can significantly slow
the rate of motor and language decline. The treatment is most effective
when started BEFORE significant neurological damage has occurred — ideally
at the earliest signs of disease.

Had Eli been diagnosed at age 5–6 (when motor regression was first
evident), he could have been started on cerliponase alfa at a time when
he was still walking independently, still speaking in sentences, and
still had preserved cognitive function. By the time he was diagnosed at
age 9, he was wheelchair-dependent, nearly nonverbal, cognitively
severely impaired, and had a G-tube. The window for maximum therapeutic
benefit had largely closed.

This does not mean treatment at age 9 is futile — the family has been
referred to a CLN2 treatment center for evaluation — but the potential
for preserved function is significantly diminished compared to what
might have been achieved with earlier diagnosis.

The estimated delay from recognizable symptoms to diagnosis: 5–6 years.
The estimated delay from first provider concern to diagnosis: 20 months.
The estimated delay attributable to COVID-19: 9 months.
The estimated delay attributable to diagnostic overshadowing by ASD: 4+ years.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INDIVIDUALS WHO RAISED CONCERN (documented in this section):

  1. Danielle Reeves (Mother) — raised concerns as early as age 4–5,
     repeatedly, at every visit. Researched symptoms online. Was told
     her son "has autism" and his difficulties were "part of ASD."

  2. Dr. Michael Okafor, MD (Orthopedics) — first physician to formally
     document that Eli's presentation was "NOT consistent with ASD" and
     recommend neurology re-evaluation (July 2019). Reiterated concern
     at every subsequent visit. Wrote formal letter (March 2020).

  3. Sarah Lindgren, DPT (Physical Therapy) — meticulously documented
     progressive decline with standardized measures. Wrote the landmark
     formal letter of concern (March 2020) detailing specific clinical
     findings inconsistent with ASD, including a differential diagnosis
     that CORRECTLY listed NCL as the first consideration. This letter
     is a model of interprofessional advocacy.

  4. Dr. Amara Osei, MD, PhD (Neurology) — upon first evaluation,
     immediately recognized the neurodegenerative pattern, ordered
     appropriate workup, and confirmed the diagnosis within 6 weeks.
     Documented the phenomenon of diagnostic overshadowing in the record.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  This concludes Section 3 of 6.

  Section 4 will cover: Genetic confirmation, ophthalmology evaluation,
  CLN2 treatment center evaluation, and palliative care initiation
  (ages 9–10, 2021–2022).

the transferred medical file. She offered to bring this to the visit but was
advised we would review it at a dedicated follow-up appointment due to time
constraints.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Eli is a 10-year-old mixed-race (Black/White) male presenting to establish
primary care following a military PCS from Fort Benning, GA to Fort Liberty,
NC. Per transferred records and parental report, Eli carries diagnoses of:
  1. Autism Spectrum Disorder (diagnosed age 3.5, Virginia)
  2. Epilepsy, generalized (diagnosed age 9, Ohio/Georgia)
  3. Progressive motor decline — wheelchair dependent since approximately
     age 9.5
  4. Developmental regression (ongoing)
  5. Scoliosis, mild thoracolumbar (monitored)

Per mother, Eli was a full-term infant who met early milestones on time. He
began to show developmental concerns around age 18-24 months with delayed
walking (achieved at 26 months) and language plateau. He was diagnosed with
autism spectrum disorder at age 3.5 by a developmental pediatrician in
Virginia. Mother states she has always felt the diagnosis did not fully explain
Eli's presentation, particularly the LOSS of skills over time.

Eli's motor function has progressively declined: he walked independently until
approximately age 7-8, then required AFOs, then a walker, and has been
wheelchair-dependent since approximately age 9.5. His speech has regressed from
short sentences (age 4-5) to primarily single words. He was diagnosed with
epilepsy at age 9 after an EEG showed abnormalities. He is currently on
levetiracetam (Keppra) 500mg BID. Mother reports seizures are not fully
controlled — she observes 3-5 staring episodes daily, each lasting 5-15
seconds, with brief post-event confusion. She also reports nocturnal events
(jerking movements) occurring several times per week, which she monitors via
a baby monitor with camera.

Mother reports that a neurologist in Ohio/Georgia (Dr. Osei) recommended
genetic testing, but this was never completed before the family's PCS. Mother
is very concerned about the ongoing decline and the incomplete workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  - ASD (age 3.5)
  - Epilepsy, generalized (age 9) — on levetiracetam
  - Progressive motor decline (wheelchair dependent)
  - Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis
  - History of constipation (chronic, managed with MiraLAX)
  - No surgical history

MEDICATIONS:
  1. Levetiracetam (Keppra) 500mg PO BID
  2. Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX) 8.5g PO daily
  3. Melatonin 3mg PO QHS PRN

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. No food allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:
  - Mother: Denise Reeves, age 34, healthy. No significant medical history.
  - Father: Marcus Reeves, SGT, USA, age 36, healthy. History of migraines.
  - Paternal grandmother: "memory problems" reportedly beginning in her 60s.
    No formal diagnosis documented. Deceased at age 71.
  - Maternal grandmother: Hypertension, type 2 diabetes. Living, age 62.
  - No siblings.
  - No known family history of seizures, autism, or neurodegenerative disease
    (per available records; family history may be incomplete).

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Family recently relocated from Fort Benning, GA to Fort Liberty, NC. Father
is active-duty Army (SGT, E-5), infantry. Mother is primary caregiver and is
not currently employed outside the home due to Eli's care needs. Eli is
enrolled in Cumberland County Schools, exceptional children's program. He
receives home-based services including PT and OT. The family lives in on-post
housing. Mother reports adequate support from military family services but
significant stress related to Eli's medical complexity and the disruption of
care caused by the move. This is the family's third PCS since Eli's birth
(Virginia → Georgia → North Carolina).

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  Constitutional: Poor weight gain. Fatigue noted. No fevers.
  HEENT: Mother reports concern about vision — "sometimes he doesn't seem to
    see things." No hearing concerns. Chronic constipation.
  Neurological: Seizures as described above. Progressive motor decline.
    Regression in speech and fine motor skills. Tremor noted in hands.
  Musculoskeletal: Wheelchair dependent. Mild scoliosis. Joint contractures
    developing at ankles bilaterally.
  Psychiatric/Behavioral: Sleep disturbance. Irritability (increasing).
    Hand-wringing stereotypies (constant when awake).
  All other systems reviewed and negative or as noted above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Vitals:
    Height: 53.2 inches (135.1 cm) — 10th percentile for age
    Weight: 62 lbs (28.1 kg) — 8th percentile for age
    BMI: 15.4 kg/m² — 18th percentile
    HR: 88 bpm | BP: 98/62 mmHg | Temp: 98.4°F | SpO2: 98% RA
    Head circumference: 52.8 cm (35th percentile)

  General: Thin male appearing stated age, seated in wheelchair. Alert. Makes
    brief eye contact. Minimal spontaneous verbalization.
  HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light —
    but response appears sluggish bilaterally. Extraocular movements: difficulty
    with smooth pursuit tracking. TMs clear bilaterally. Oropharynx clear.
    Dentition fair — mild crowding.
  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
  Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
  Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
  Abdomen: Soft, mildly distended (likely stool burden), non-tender. Bowel
    sounds present. No organomegaly.
  Musculoskeletal: Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis (convex right). Bilateral
    ankle contractures (approximately 10 degrees from neutral). Decreased
    muscle bulk throughout. Increased tone in lower extremities, decreased
    tone in trunk.
  Skin: No rashes or lesions. Skin intact under wheelchair straps.
  Neurological:
    - Mental status: Alert, responds to name. Minimal verbal output — said
      "mama" once and "no" once during the visit. Follows simple one-step
      commands inconsistently. Does not appear to understand complex
      instructions.
    - Cranial nerves: Difficult to formally assess. See pupillary response
      above. Facial symmetry present. Gag intact.
    - Motor: Wheelchair-bound. Unable to stand or bear weight. Upper
      extremities: can reach for objects but grasp is weak and imprecise.
      Significant cerebellar-type ataxia in upper extremities (intention
      tremor, past-pointing). Constant hand-wringing stereotypies when not
      reaching for objects.
    - Reflexes: 3+ throughout. Bilateral extensor plantar responses (Babinski
      positive bilaterally).
    - Coordination: Severely impaired (see motor exam).
    - Involuntary movements: Multiple brief staring episodes observed during
      the 20-minute visit (2 episodes, each approximately 10 seconds duration,
      with behavioral arrest and subtle eyelid flutter, followed by brief
      confusion). Myoclonic jerks observed in upper extremities (3 episodes —
      brief, bilateral, symmetric jerks of arms/shoulders).

DEVELOPMENTAL ASSESSMENT:
Per available records and observation, Eli is functioning at a significantly
below age-level across all developmental domains. Estimated developmental
age approximately 18-24 months for communication, <12 months for gross motor
(non-ambulatory), approximately 12-18 months for fine motor, and approximately
18-24 months for adaptive/self-care. He requires total assistance for all
activities of daily living (feeding, dressing, bathing, toileting).

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

ICD-10 Codes:
  F84.0 — Autistic disorder (historical, per prior diagnosis)
  G40.309 — Generalized idiopathic epilepsy, not intractable
  R62.52 — Short stature (child)
  R62.51 — Failure to thrive (child)
  G80.9 — Cerebral palsy, unspecified (working dx for motor impairment)
  M41.20 — Other idiopathic scoliosis, site unspecified
  R47.1 — Dysarthria and anarthria

ASSESSMENT:
Complex neurodevelopmental and neurological presentation in a 10-year-old male
with a history of autism spectrum disorder per prior evaluation, epilepsy
(partially controlled on levetiracetam 500mg BID), progressive motor decline
resulting in wheelchair dependence, and ongoing developmental regression across
all domains. The degree of regression and progressive nature of this
presentation is atypical for isolated autism spectrum disorder. The combination
of progressive motor decline, seizures, possible visual concerns, and global
regression raises concern for an underlying neurodegenerative or
neurometabolic process. However, records are critically incomplete — key
neurology records, imaging studies, EEG results, and laboratory data from the
prior duty station were not included in the transfer packet.

PLAN:
1. URGENT neurology referral — submitted to TRICARE for pediatric neurology
   at Womack Army Medical Center or community care network. Marked as urgent
   given active seizure disorder with incomplete control and progressive
   neurological decline.
2. Request complete records from ALL prior providers:
   a. Dr. James Whitfield, Pediatrics — Hampton, VA
   b. Developmental pediatrics evaluation — Virginia (provider name unknown,
      mother to provide)
   c. Neurology — Virginia (provider name unknown)
   d. Dr. Kevin Chen, Neurology — Columbus, GA / Nationwide Children's
   e. Dr. Adwoa Osei, Neurology — Columbus, GA (PRIORITY — mother reports
      this provider recommended genetic testing)
   f. MRI facilities — Virginia and Georgia
   g. EEG facility — Georgia
3. Schedule extended follow-up visit in 4 weeks to review mother's personal
   record binder and all incoming records.
4. Continue current medications: levetiracetam 500mg BID, MiraLAX daily,
   melatonin QHS PRN.
5. Referral to Cumberland County Schools for IEP transfer and evaluation.
6. PT/OT referrals for home-based services.
7. If seizure frequency increases or any prolonged seizure (>2 minutes),
   family instructed to call 911. Discussed rescue medication (diazepam
   rectal gel) — will defer to neurology for this prescription.

Return in 4 weeks for record review, sooner PRN.

ENCOUNTER NOTE — FOLLOW-UP / RECORDS REVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of Service: 12/15/2022
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS
DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 10 years 9 months | Sex: Male
MRN: FV-2022-08841
Visit Type: Follow-Up — Established Patient (30 min)

REASON FOR VISIT:
Follow-up. Review of additional records received. Ongoing seizure management.

RECORDS UPDATE:
Since the initial visit, the following additional records have been received:
  RECEIVED:
  - MRI brain report, age 6 (Riverside Radiology, Columbus, GA): "Mildly
    prominent ventricles, likely normal variant. No acute intracranial
    pathology." No comparison to prior imaging was performed at that time.
  - ABA therapy summary (Virginia, ages 4-6): Documents minimal progress,
    notes "difficulty with skill retention."
  - Dr. James Whitfield (Virginia) — partial records, well-child visits only.
    No developmental pediatrics referral letter or evaluation report included.
  - IEP records from Georgia (2020-2022).

  STILL NOT RECEIVED:
  - MRI brain report, age 9 — requested twice from Piedmont Columbus Regional;
    no response.
  - EEG report, age 9 — requested from Columbus Neuroscience Associates.
    Office states they are "locating the file."
  - Dr. Adwoa Osei neurology records — requested from Columbus Neuroscience
    Associates. Same response as above.
  - Laboratory results (metabolic studies, age 9) — NOT received.
  - Virginia neurology and developmental pediatrics records — provider names
    could not be confirmed from available documentation. Mother states the
    developmental evaluation was performed at "a clinic in Norfolk" but does
    not recall the specific provider name.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Mother reports that Eli's seizure activity has been relatively stable since
the last visit — approximately 3-5 observable staring episodes daily.
Nocturnal jerking continues 3-4 nights per week. No prolonged seizures. No
ER visits. Appetite remains poor. Constipation managed with MiraLAX. Mother
reports that a neurologist in Ohio (Dr. Osei) recommended genetic testing but
this was never completed before the family's PCS. She states Dr. Osei
"finally said it wasn't just autism" and wanted to pursue genetic workup, but
the family received PCS orders before this could be initiated.

Mother brought her personal record binder to this visit. I reviewed portions
of it with her during the appointment. The binder contains handwritten notes,
printed lab results, therapy progress reports, school evaluations, and
photographs documenting Eli's functional decline over time. Mother's
documentation is detailed and organized chronologically. Several items in the
binder are not present in any of the medical records we have received through
official channels, including:
  - A note from a physical therapist (Georgia, 2021) stating: "This does not
    look like typical ASD motor involvement. Recommend neurology re-evaluation
    for possible neurodegenerative process."
  - A handwritten note from mother documenting a conversation with Dr. Osei
    in which genetic testing was recommended.

PLAN:
1. Neurology referral remains active — appointment not yet scheduled. Current
   estimated wait is 4 months through TRICARE community care network. I will
   request Womack AMC neurology directly as a military-dependent priority.
2. Continue to pursue outstanding records. Third request sent to Columbus
   Neuroscience Associates and Piedmont Columbus Regional.
3. Continue levetiracetam 500mg BID.
4. Follow-up at 11-year well-child visit.
5. Mother counseled on seizure first aid and when to call 911.

ENCOUNTER NOTE — 11-YEAR WELL-CHILD VISIT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of Service: 03/20/2023
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS
DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 11 years 0 months | Sex: Male
MRN: FV-2022-08841
Visit Type: Well-Child / Preventive — Annual

REASON FOR VISIT:
Annual well-child examination. Ongoing management of complex medical issues.

VITALS:
  Height: 54.8 inches (139.2 cm) — 8th percentile for age (↓ from 10th)
  Weight: 65 lbs (29.5 kg) — 5th percentile for age (↓ from 8th)
  BMI: 15.2 kg/m² — 12th percentile (↓ from 18th)
  HR: 92 bpm | BP: 100/60 mmHg | Temp: 98.6°F | SpO2: 97% RA

GROWTH TREND:
Height and weight percentiles continue to decline. Growth velocity has slowed
significantly over the past 12 months. BMI percentile also declining. This
pattern is consistent with progressive nutritional compromise in the setting
of neurological decline and feeding difficulties. Mother reports Eli eats
only soft/pureed foods now — he has difficulty with chewing and occasionally
coughs when drinking thin liquids.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Per mother, Eli's condition has continued to decline over the past 3 months.
Seizure frequency has increased. Mother reports Eli is now having 5-8
observable seizure episodes daily — mostly brief staring spells (5-15
seconds) but also myoclonic jerks that are more frequent and more forceful
than previously. Nocturnal seizures occur several times per week — mother
monitors with a baby monitor and reports seeing rhythmic jerking episodes
lasting 10-30 seconds during sleep.

Speech has further declined. Eli now uses only 3-4 recognizable words
("mama," "no," "eat," and occasionally "dada"). He communicates primarily
through gestures (reaching, pushing away) and vocalizations (crying,
laughing). Eye contact is rare.

Mother reports increasing difficulty with feeding, as noted above. Also
reports Eli seems to startle easily and becomes distressed with bright lights
or loud sounds.

Mother is frustrated that the neurology appointment has not yet been
scheduled. She reports calling TRICARE twice and being told the referral is
"in process."

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  General: Thin male, appears fatigued. Seated in wheelchair. Limited
    spontaneous movement.
  HEENT: Pupils reactive but sluggish. Difficulty tracking — does not
    consistently follow objects across midline. Oral mucosa moist. Mild
    drooling noted.
  Neurological: As previously documented with the following changes:
    - Verbal output further reduced (see above).
    - Upper extremity ataxia appears worse — difficulty bringing hand to
      mouth consistently.
    - Myoclonic jerks more prominent — observed 4 episodes during visit.
    - Two staring episodes observed during visit, each ~10 seconds.
    - Increased lower extremity spasticity compared to prior exam.
    - Ankle contractures progressing (now ~15 degrees bilaterally).
  Remainder of exam: Stable from prior.

IMMUNIZATIONS:
Tdap booster administered today (right deltoid). Mother declines HPV vaccine
at this time — will revisit.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Epilepsy, worsening — seizure frequency increasing despite levetiracetam
   500mg BID (current weight-based dose: 17 mg/kg/day, which is below
   optimal range of 20-30 mg/kg/day for his weight). Dose adjustment
   indicated.
2. Progressive neurological decline — ongoing regression in motor, speech,
   and likely visual domains.
3. Failure to thrive / declining growth — nutritional concerns with emerging
   dysphagia.
4. Awaiting neurology evaluation — unacceptable delay.

PLAN:
1. Increase levetiracetam to 750mg PO BID (25 mg/kg/day) — discussed with
   mother, she is agreeable. Prescription sent to Womack pharmacy.
2. Neurology referral: I personally called the TRICARE referral management
   center today and escalated this case. Also placed a direct referral to
   Womack AMC pediatric neurology through the military system. Mother still
   waiting for appointment — I impressed upon referral coordinator that this
   is URGENT.
3. Swallowing evaluation referral — speech-language pathology for modified
   barium swallow study to assess aspiration risk.
4. Nutritional supplementation: Recommended PediaSure 1.5 cal, 1-2 cans
   daily to support caloric intake.
5. Continue MiraLAX, melatonin.
6. Follow-up in 3 months or sooner PRN.
7. Seizure action plan reviewed with mother. Discussed obtaining diastat
   (diazepam rectal gel) for seizure rescue — will defer to neurology but
   if appointment not scheduled within 30 days, I will prescribe.

  Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS | DOB: 03/15/2012
  MRN: CFVMC-7829103 | Arrival: 14:22 | Disposition: 17:45

  CHIEF COMPLAINT: Seizure, prolonged

  HPI: 11-year-old male with history of epilepsy (on levetiracetam) and
  ASD brought in by EMS after a seizure at home lasting approximately 3
  minutes per mother's report. Mother states the seizure began as a
  staring episode that progressed to bilateral arm stiffening, then
  rhythmic jerking of all four extremities. Total duration approximately
  3 minutes. Patient was postictal on EMS arrival — responsive to pain
  only. No cyanosis per mother. No head trauma. No fever. This is the
  longest seizure the family has observed. Mother did not have rescue
  medication (diastat) at home.

  EMS report: GCS 8 on arrival (E2 V2 M4). Improving during transport.
  Vitals in field: HR 112, BP 105/70, SpO2 96% RA, glucose 94.

  ED EXAM (15:05, approximately 45 minutes post-seizure):
  Patient drowsy but arousable. GCS 13 (E3 V4 M6). Oriented to self
  (responds to name). PERRL. No focal neurological deficits beyond
  baseline. No signs of trauma.

  LABS:
    Levetiracetam level: 28.4 mcg/mL (therapeutic: 12-46 mcg/mL) —

    CBC: WBC 7.2, Hgb 12.1, Plt 245 — all within normal limits
    Lactate: 2.1 mmol/L (mildly elevated, may be post-seizure)

  CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No acute intracranial process. Diffuse
  volume loss noted, likely chronic and consistent with known history.

  COURSE: Patient returned to baseline mental status over approximately
  90 minutes. Tolerated oral fluids. No further seizures during
  observation period (3 hours).

  ASSESSMENT: Breakthrough seizure (generalized tonic-clonic, ~3
  minutes) in setting of known epilepsy. Levetiracetam level therapeutic.

  PLAN:
  1. Discharge home with family.
  2. Seizure precautions reviewed.
  3. Prescribed: Diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) 10mg — for seizures
     lasting >2 minutes. Administration instructions reviewed with
     mother.
  4. Follow-up with PCP within 48 hours.
  5. Neurology follow-up — EXPEDITED. ER physician contacted Womack AMC
     neurology on-call and obtained agreement for urgent outpatient
     appointment within 2 weeks.

  ====================================================================

DR. WASHINGTON FOLLOW-UP NOTE:

Eli is seen today 2 days after his ER visit for a prolonged seizure. Mother
reports Eli has been more fatigued than usual since the event. He has had his
typical staring spells (4-5 today per mother) but no further generalized
seizures. She has the diastat at home now and reviewed the administration
instructions with me again today. She is confident she can administer it if
needed.

Mother is emotional today. She expressed frustration that Eli has been having
seizures for over 2 years, is on medication, and yet has not been seen by a
neurologist since their move to North Carolina. She stated: "We have been
here over a year and he still hasn't seen a brain doctor. I keep telling
everyone something is really wrong and nobody is listening."

I share her frustration. Given the severity of this episode, I have contacted
the Womack AMC pediatric neurology clinic directly to confirm the expedited
appointment arranged by the ER. I spoke with the scheduling coordinator who
confirmed an appointment with Dr. Samuel Park, Pediatric Neurology, for
08/15/2023. I also sent a detailed referral letter summarizing Eli's complete
history as known to me, the missing records, and the mother's observations.

PLAN:
1. Neurology appointment confirmed: 08/15/2023 with Dr. Samuel Park at
   Womack AMC.
2. Continue levetiracetam 750mg BID.
3. Diastat 10mg at home — use for seizures >2 minutes.
4. Mother to bring complete record binder to neurology appointment.
5. I have prepared a printed summary of all records in our system to send
   with the referral.
6. Follow-up with me after neurology appointment.

ENCOUNTER NOTE — 12-YEAR WELL-CHILD VISIT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of Service: 03/18/2024
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS
DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 12 years 0 months | Sex: Male
MRN: FV-2022-08841
Visit Type: Well-Child / Preventive — Annual

REASON FOR VISIT:
Annual well-child examination.

VITALS:
  Height: 56.5 inches (143.5 cm) — 5th percentile for age (↓ from 8th)
  Weight: 70 lbs (31.8 kg) — 3rd percentile for age (↓ from 5th)
  BMI: 15.4 kg/m² — 6th percentile (↓ from 12th)
  HR: 86 bpm | BP: 102/64 mmHg | Temp: 98.2°F | SpO2: 97% RA

GROWTH TREND:
Continued decline in all growth parameters. Height has dropped from 10th to
5th percentile over 2 years. Weight now at 3rd percentile. BMI at 6th
percentile. Growth failure in the context of progressive neurological disease
and feeding difficulties. Modified barium swallow study (performed 01/2024)
showed mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with thin liquid penetration to the
level of the laryngeal vestibule. Recommendation: nectar-thick liquids,
soft/pureed foods, upright positioning for all meals.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Eli was seen by Dr. Samuel Park (Pediatric Neurology, Womack AMC) in
September 2023. Per Dr. Park's report (received), extensive workup has been
initiated including MRI, prolonged EEG, ophthalmology evaluation, and
genetics referral. Mother reports Dr. Park believes Eli may have a
neurodegenerative condition rather than (or in addition to) autism. She
states this was "the first time a doctor looked at everything together."

Since last visit, Eli's functional status has continued to decline. He is
now largely non-verbal. He communicates with gestures — reaching, pushing
away — and occasional single words. "Mama" is the most consistently used.
He sometimes says "no" or makes vocalizations that mother interprets
contextually. He requires total care for all activities of daily living:
feeding (pureed foods, must be fed by caregiver), dressing, bathing,
toileting (in diapers), transfers (requires full lift from wheelchair).

Seizures remain poorly controlled despite levetiracetam dose optimization
(now 750mg BID). Dr. Park has added clobazam (Onfi) 5mg BID, which mother
reports has reduced the frequency somewhat — from 5-8 daily to approximately
3-5 daily. No further prolonged seizures since the July 2023 ER visit.
Nocturnal events continue.

Mother reports increased startle responses to sounds and light. She notes
that Eli seems to see less well — "He doesn't reach for things unless they
are right in front of him, and sometimes not even then." Ophthalmology
evaluation has been completed (results to be reviewed with neurology).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  General: Thin adolescent male seated in wheelchair. Appears small for
    stated age. Alert but minimally interactive. Occasional vocalization.
    Drooling present.
  HEENT: Mild facial hypotonia. Sluggish pupillary responses bilaterally.
    Does not consistently track moving objects. Oropharynx moist, mild
    pooling of secretions.
  Cardiovascular: RRR, no murmurs.
  Respiratory: Clear bilaterally. No increased work of breathing.
  Abdomen: Soft, non-distended today. G-tube site — N/A (not placed).
  Musculoskeletal: Progressive contractures — ankles now ~20 degrees
    bilaterally, mild knee flexion contractures developing. Scoliosis
    appears stable (monitored by ortho). Significant muscle wasting in
    extremities and trunk.
  Neurological:
    - Verbal output: rare single words only (see above).
    - No purposeful fine motor function — cannot grasp small objects. Can
      perform gross reach with severe ataxia.
    - Constant hand-wringing stereotypies persist.
    - Myoclonic jerks: frequent (6 observed during 25-minute visit).
    - Two staring episodes observed (~8 seconds and ~12 seconds).
    - Spasticity increased in lower extremities.
    - Bilateral Babinski positive (unchanged).
  Skin: Mild pressure erythema over sacrum — discussed repositioning
    schedule with mother.

IMMUNIZATIONS: Up to date. HPV #1 deferred — discussed with mother, she
wishes to wait given medical complexity.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Progressive neurodegenerative condition — under active workup with
   Dr. Park (neurology) and pending genetics referral. Historical ASD
   diagnosis is being formally reconsidered. The progressive trajectory
   is not consistent with autism spectrum disorder.
2. Epilepsy, refractory — partially improved with addition of clobazam.
   Multiple seizure types (absence, myoclonic, and rare generalized
   tonic-clonic).
3. Growth failure — declining across all parameters. Nutritional
   compromise secondary to dysphagia and progressive neurological decline.
   May need gastrostomy tube in the future if oral intake continues to
   decline.
4. Dysphagia — managed with diet modification per SLP recommendations.
5. Progressive contractures — PT ongoing.
6. Caregiver stress — mother is sole daytime caregiver. Father's military
   duties limit his availability.

PLAN:
1. Continue all current medications (levetiracetam 750mg BID, clobazam
   5mg BID, MiraLAX, melatonin).
2. Nutrition: Continue PediaSure 1.5 cal supplementation. Referral to
   pediatric nutrition for caloric optimization. Discuss gastrostomy tube
   with neurology and family if weight drops below 3rd percentile or if
   aspiration risk worsens.
3. I have printed ALL records from our system for the family to bring to
   the genetics appointment. I have also asked mother to bring her
   complete personal record binder. The neurology appointment scheduled
   for next month — I will provide records directly to Dr. Park as well.
4. Pressure injury prevention: Reviewed repositioning schedule (every 2
   hours). Wheelchair cushion assessment with PT.
5. Respite care referral through EFMP (Exceptional Family Member Program).
6. Follow-up in 3 months or sooner PRN.

TELEPHONE ENCOUNTER
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of Service: 09/16/2024
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS
DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 12 years 6 months | Sex: Male
MRN: FV-2022-08841
Encounter Type: Telephone — Mother (Denise Reeves)
Time: 10:35 AM | Duration: 18 minutes
Staff: Lisa Washington, MD

CALL SUMMARY:
Mrs. Reeves called requesting copies of all medical records for a genetics
referral. She reports that Dr. Park (neurology) has referred Eli to the Duke
Genetics Clinic for comprehensive genetic evaluation, including whole exome
sequencing. However, the insurance company (TRICARE) has denied the genetic
testing panel, stating it is "not medically necessary."

Mrs. Reeves is very frustrated. She states: "They are telling me that testing
to find out what is actually wrong with my son is not medically necessary. He
is 12 years old. He can't walk, he can barely talk, he is having seizures
every day, and nobody knows WHY. How is it not necessary to find out why?"

She reports that Dr. Park has already submitted an appeal letter. She is
requesting that I also provide a supporting letter documenting the medical
necessity of genetic testing from the primary care perspective.

I told Mrs. Reeves that I will prepare and send a letter today. She is also
requesting a complete copy of Eli's records from our office to provide to
the genetics clinic.

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Medical necessity letter prepared and signed (see attached). Letter
   documents:
   - 12-year history of progressive neurological decline
   - Multiple seizure types refractory to medication
   - Progressive cerebellar and cerebral atrophy on serial MRI
   - Progressive visual loss with retinal degeneration
   - Growth failure
   - Unknown etiology despite extensive evaluation
   - Recommendation from two specialists (neurology and pediatrics) that
     genetic testing including whole exome sequencing is medically necessary
     to identify the underlying diagnosis and guide management, including
     identification of any available targeted therapies or clinical trials
   - Reference to ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics) guidelines
     supporting WES for undiagnosed neurodegenerative conditions

2. Complete records from our office printed and prepared for family pickup.

3. Letter faxed to TRICARE appeals department: (844) 555-0199.

4. Copy of letter sent to Dr. Samuel Park, Womack AMC Neurology, and to
   Duke Genetics Clinic (Dr. Rachel Kim) via fax.

Clinic: Womack AMC Pediatric Neurology

CONSULTATION REQUEST:
"11yo male with h/o ASD, epilepsy, progressive motor and cognitive decline,
wheelchair dependent. Seizures partially controlled on Keppra. Recent ER
visit for prolonged seizure. Possible neurodegenerative process. Please
evaluate and advise." — Dr. Lisa Washington, 07/18/2023.

RECORDS REVIEWED:
Prior to this evaluation, I reviewed the following:
  1. Dr. Lisa Washington's referral letter and office records (06/2022 —
     07/2023)
  2. Cape Fear Valley Medical Center ER record (07/16/2023)

     variant," recommends continued ASD services. No genetic workup ordered.
  9. Dr. Adwoa Osei (neurology, Columbus, GA) — 2 visit notes, partially
     legible. Fax quality poor — approximately 40% of text unreadable. What
     is legible documents: EEG performed (results referenced but report not
     included), MRI age 9 ordered (report referenced but not included),
     "[unreadable]...genetic workup recommended...CLN or mitochondrial
     [unreadable]...family relocating..."

RECORDS NOT AVAILABLE despite multiple requests:
  - EEG report (age 9) — original report not obtained
  - MRI brain report (age 9) — original report not obtained
  - Laboratory results including metabolic panel (age 9) — not obtained
  - All Virginia records (ages 0-7) — not obtained
  - Original developmental pediatrics evaluation (age 3.5) — not obtained

MOTHER'S PERSONAL DOCUMENTATION:
Mrs. Denise Reeves brought a comprehensive personal binder to this
appointment containing records, handwritten notes, photographs, and
observations spanning Eli's entire life. This is the first time I have been
able to review records spanning the patient's entire developmental and
medical trajectory, thanks to the mother's personal documentation. I spent
approximately 45 minutes reviewing this binder prior to examining the
patient. Key items from the binder that are NOT available in any official
medical record transfer include:

  a. Mother's handwritten developmental timeline documenting milestone
     acquisition AND LOSS — with specific dates and examples
  b. Photographs showing Eli walking independently (age 3-4), walking with
     unsteady gait (age 6-7), using a walker (age 8), and in wheelchair
     (age 9-present). The visual documentation of motor decline is striking.
  c. Home video clips on mother's phone showing: staring episodes (age 4-5,
     labeled by mother as "the spells nobody believed me about"), myoclonic
     jerks during sleep (age 8), and a generalized seizure (age 10).
  d. A note from a physical therapist in Georgia (2021): "This does not look
     like typical ASD motor involvement. Recommend neurology re-evaluation
     for possible neurodegenerative process."
  e. Mother's handwritten account of Dr. Osei's verbal recommendation for
     genetic testing, with the specific note: "Dr. Osei said this is NOT
     autism. She said it's something else, something genetic. She wanted to
     do testing but we got orders to move."
  f. A printed screenshot of an online search result for "autism regression
     seizures cerebellar atrophy" dated 2021, with mother's handwritten
     annotation: "Batten disease? — asked Dr. Huang, she said probably not
     but to mention it to neurology."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Eli is an 11-year-6-month-old mixed-race male referred for comprehensive
neurological evaluation in the setting of a reportedly progressive
neurodevelopmental condition historically attributed to autism spectrum
disorder.

DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY (reconstructed from all available sources):

  Birth — 12 months: Unremarkable. Full-term, normal delivery, APGAR 8/9.
  Appropriate early milestones — social smile at 6 weeks, sitting at 6
  months, babbling by 8 months, first words at 12 months.

  12 — 24 months: First signs of concern. Vocabulary plateaued at
  approximately 20 words by age 2. Walking achieved at 26 months (delayed).
  Parents noted he was "not keeping up" with peers.

  2 — 4 years: Walked but unsteadily (toe-walking noted). Speech remained
  limited to single words and 2-word phrases. Hand-wringing movements began.
  Staring spells noted by parents — dismissed as "daydreaming." Diagnosed
  with ASD at age 3.5 based on limited speech, repetitive hand movements,
  and social withdrawal.

  4 — 7 years: REGRESSION became apparent. Per mother, Eli could button his
  shirt at age 4 but not at age 6. Walking became increasingly unsteady.
  Speech regressed from short phrases to primarily single words. Staring
  spells increased in frequency (15-30 seconds, with post-event confusion).
  Night-time events described (waking, appearing frightened and disoriented).
  MRI age 6: "mildly prominent ventricles, normal variant." No metabolic or
  genetic workup performed. Family moved from Virginia to Georgia.

  7 — 10 years: Accelerating decline. Required AFOs by age 8. Wheelchair by
  age 9.5. Speech reduced to single words. Staring spells 2-3 per day.
  Myoclonic jerks noted during sleep. EEG age 9 (report unavailable but
  referenced in Dr. Osei's partially legible note): showed epileptiform
  activity. MRI age 9 (report unavailable but referenced): reportedly showed
  cerebellar atrophy. Basic labs reportedly included elevated lactate (per
  mother's binder notes, though lab report not available). Dr. Osei
  recommended genetic workup — not completed before PCS.

  10 — present: Wheelchair dependent. Seizures multiple times daily despite
  levetiracetam. Speech limited to 4-5 recognizable words. Prolonged seizure
  requiring ER visit (07/2023). Visual concerns emerging. Growth declining.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
  1. Levetiracetam (Keppra) 750mg PO BID
  2. Diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) 10mg PRN seizure >2 min
  3. Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX) 8.5g PO daily
  4. Melatonin 3mg PO QHS PRN

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:

  Mental Status:
  - Arousal: Alert, eyes open spontaneously.
  - Attention: Inconsistent. Turns to name approximately 50% of the time.
    Turns to loud sounds consistently.
  - Language — Receptive: Follows simple one-step commands inconsistently
    ("give me your hand" — complied 1 of 3 attempts). Does not follow
    two-step commands. Appears to understand tone of voice (calm vs. urgent).
  - Language — Expressive: Extremely limited. During the 60-minute
    evaluation, the following verbalizations were noted: "mama" (x3), "no"
    (x2), one episode of crying, and several non-specific vocalizations.
    Mother reports "eat" and "dada" are also in his repertoire but were not
    observed today.
  - Affect: Flat affect for most of the exam. Brief smile when mother spoke
    to him softly. Cried briefly during fundoscopic exam.

  Cranial Nerves:
  - CN I: Not tested.
  - CN II: Visual acuity — unable to formally test. Does not reliably fixate
    on small objects. Appears to perceive large, high-contrast objects within
    approximately 12 inches. Does NOT consistently track moving objects
    across midline. Blink to visual threat: inconsistent (present on left,
    absent on right in 3 trials — may reflect visual field deficit vs.
    inattention). CONCERN FOR PROGRESSIVE VISUAL LOSS.
  - CN II — Fundoscopic exam: SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS. Optic discs appear pale
    bilaterally — RIGHT more than LEFT. Disc margins distinct. Cup-to-disc
    ratio 0.3 bilaterally. Subtle granular changes in macular region
    bilaterally — difficult to fully characterize on bedside exam. POSSIBLE
    OPTIC ATROPHY. URGENT OPHTHALMOLOGY REFERRAL INDICATED.
  - CN III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements — full range but with saccadic
    (jerky) pursuit. No nystagmus at rest. Gaze-evoked nystagmus present
    on lateral gaze bilaterally. Pupils: 4mm bilaterally, reactive to light
    but SLUGGISH (estimated 2+ bilaterally, should be 3-4+).
  - CN V: Facial sensation intact to light touch (withdraws from stimulus).
    Corneal reflex present bilaterally. Jaw strength — limited assessment,
    appears weak (difficulty chewing per history).
  - CN VII: Mild facial hypotonia. Symmetric at rest. Smile present but
    weak. Drooling present (poor oral motor control).
  - CN VIII: Turns to sound bilaterally. No formal audiometry — hearing
    appears grossly intact.
  - CN IX, X: Gag reflex present. Voice quality — wet/gurgly quality on the
    few vocalizations observed. Consistent with oropharyngeal dysphagia.
  - CN XI: Shoulder shrug — minimal, weak bilaterally.
  - CN XII: Tongue — protrudes midline. Atrophic appearance. Fasciculations
    not clearly observed.

  Motor Examination:
  - Bulk: Diffusely decreased. Significant muscle wasting in distal
    extremities and trunk musculature. Upper arms relatively preserved.
  - Tone: MIXED pattern.
    * Upper extremities: Mildly increased tone with intermittent dystonic
      posturing (wrist flexion, finger extension). Superimposed upon baseline
      of mildly decreased truncal tone.
    * Lower extremities: Significantly increased tone bilaterally. Spasticity
      present (velocity-dependent) at knees and ankles. Ankle clonus: 4-5
      beats bilaterally.
  - Strength: Severely limited volitional movement.
    * Upper extremities: Can reach for objects (antigravity), but movements
      are grossly ataxic and weak. Grip strength markedly reduced — cannot
      maintain grasp. Estimated 2-3/5 proximally, 1-2/5 distally.
    * Lower extremities: No volitional movement against gravity. Trace
      withdrawal to pain. Estimated 1/5 throughout.
    * Trunk: Cannot sit unsupported. Requires full wheelchair support.
  - Involuntary movements:
    * Hand-wringing stereotypies: CONSTANT when hands are not engaged.
      Bilateral, rhythmic, midline hand-wringing/washing movements. These
      are notable for their persistence and automaticity.
    * Myoclonic jerks: FREQUENT. During the 60-minute evaluation, I observed
      12 distinct myoclonic events — bilateral, symmetric, brief (<0.5 sec)
      jerks predominantly involving shoulders and arms. These occurred
      irregularly, sometimes in clusters of 2-3.
    * Dystonic posturing: Intermittent left wrist flexion/finger extension.

  Cerebellar Examination:
  - Severely impaired. Finger-to-object testing (using a toy): profound
    intention tremor and past-pointing bilaterally. Dysmetria severe —
    consistently overshoots or undershoots target. These findings are
    consistent with SEVERE CEREBELLAR DYSFUNCTION and are markedly worse
    than would be expected from the available MRI report (age 6) which
    described only "mildly prominent ventricles."

  Reflexes:
  - Biceps: 3+ bilaterally
  - Brachioradialis: 3+ bilaterally
  - Triceps: 3+ bilaterally
  - Patellar: 3+ bilaterally with crossed adductor response
  - Achilles: 3+ bilaterally with sustained clonus (4-5 beats)
  - Plantar response: EXTENSOR bilaterally (Babinski positive)
  - Jaw jerk: 2+ (mildly brisk)

  Sensation: Withdraws to pain in all four extremities. Light touch — less
  reliable response, may reflect cognitive limitation rather than sensory
  deficit. Proprioception — unable to test reliably.

  Gait: Non-ambulatory. Unable to stand or bear weight.

  SEIZURE ACTIVITY DURING EXAMINATION: Three clinical seizure events were
  observed during the 60-minute evaluation:
    Event 1 (09:35): Behavioral arrest lasting approximately 8 seconds.
    Staring, subtle eyelid flutter, cessation of hand-wringing. Followed
    by brief confusion (~5 seconds). Clinically consistent with absence
    seizure.
    Event 2 (09:48): Same as above, approximately 12 seconds duration.
    Event 3 (10:02): Cluster of 4 myoclonic jerks over approximately 3
    seconds, larger amplitude than the isolated myoclonic jerks observed
    at other times. No behavioral arrest.

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION — REVIEW OF IMAGING AND RECORDS TIMELINE:
I have spent approximately 2 hours reviewing all available records,
mother's binder, and imaging. Based on this review, I have constructed
the following diagnostic timeline:

  Age 3: MRI brain — "normal for age" (Virginia, report in binder)
  Age 3.5: Diagnosed ASD — NO genetic testing, NO metabolic testing, NO EEG
  Age 6: MRI brain — "mildly prominent ventricles, normal variant" — NOT
    compared to age-3 MRI (different state, different system)
  Age 6: Neurology (Dr. Chen) — single visit, accepted ASD diagnosis, no
    further workup
  Age 9: EEG — epileptiform activity (report not available, referenced)
  Age 9: MRI brain — cerebellar atrophy (report not available, referenced)
  Age 9: Labs — elevated lactate 2.8 mmol/L (per mother's notes, lab report
    not available)
  Age 9: Dr. Osei — recommended genetic workup — NOT COMPLETED (family PCS)
  Age 10: Transfer to NC — records incomplete. Key findings (EEG, MRI age 9,
    lactate, Dr. Osei's genetic recommendation) NOT in transferred file.
  Age 11: Current evaluation — first comprehensive review.

ASSESSMENT:

Based on thorough review of the complete developmental trajectory as
documented in the mother's records, and corroborated by the available medical
records and today's neurological examination, this patient has been
experiencing PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATION since approximately age 2-3 years,
initially mischaracterized as autism spectrum disorder.

The clinical trajectory is as follows:
  - Normal early development (0-12 months)
  - Developmental plateau then regression beginning at 18-24 months
  - Progressive loss of language, motor, and cognitive skills
  - Emergence of seizures (likely onset age 2-3 as absence seizures;
    formally diagnosed age 9)
  - Progressive cerebellar dysfunction (ataxia → immobility)
  - Progressive visual impairment (emerging)
  - Cerebellar and cerebral atrophy on imaging (progressive over serial
    studies)

This trajectory — normal early development followed by progressive
regression across ALL domains, combined with seizures, cerebellar atrophy,
and visual concerns — is CLASSIC for a neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL)
or similar progressive neurodegenerative storage disorder.

The ASD diagnosis rendered at age 3.5 was likely INCORRECT. The behavioral
features that led to the ASD diagnosis — hand-wringing stereotypies, social
withdrawal, limited communication, and reduced eye contact — are far more
likely to have been early manifestations of the neurodegenerative process
rather than features of primary autism spectrum disorder. Specifically:
  - The hand-wringing is stereotypic movement secondary to cerebellar/basal
    ganglia dysfunction, not autistic stimming behavior
  - The social withdrawal reflects progressive cognitive decline and visual
    impairment, not a primary social communication deficit
  - The language limitation reflects neurodegeneration of language networks,
    not the qualitative language differences seen in ASD
  - The "regression" attributed to ASD-related regression or anxiety was in
    fact progressive neurodegenerative disease

The anchoring on the ASD diagnosis at age 3.5 appears to have influenced
every subsequent provider evaluation for the next 8 years. Each new provider
accepted the historical diagnosis rather than re-evaluating from first
principles. The PROGRESSIVE nature of the decline — which is NOT a feature
of autism spectrum disorder — was either not recognized or was attributed to
comorbid conditions.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS (in order of clinical suspicion):
  1. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) — HIGHEST SUSPICION
     - CLN5 (Finnish variant late infantile) — onset age 4-7, progressive
       motor/cognitive decline, seizures, visual loss, cerebellar atrophy
     - CLN6 (variant late infantile) — similar phenotype to CLN5
     - CLN7 (Turkish variant late infantile) — similar
     - CLN8 (Northern epilepsy / Turkish late infantile) — similar
     - Late-onset CLN2 — less likely given age of onset
  2. Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., MERRF, MELAS, Leigh syndrome variant)
  3. Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA)
  4. GM2 gangliosidosis (late-onset Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff)
  5. Niemann-Pick type C
  6. Other lysosomal storage disorder
  7. Progressive myoclonic epilepsy — other genetic causes

PLAN:

1. MRI BRAIN — 3 Tesla with dedicated sequences:
   - Standard anatomical sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI)
   - SWI (susceptibility-weighted imaging) for iron deposition
   - MR spectroscopy (single-voxel, parietal cortex and cerebellum)
   - COMPARISON TO ALL PRIOR IMAGING (I have obtained the age-3 and age-6
     reports; will attempt to obtain actual DICOM images for side-by-side
     comparison. Age-9 MRI images requested AGAIN from Piedmont Columbus.)
   - Scheduled: 10/15/2023 at Duke Radiology (Fayetteville satellite)

2. EEG — CONTINUOUS 48-HOUR VIDEO-EEG MONITORING:
   - To characterize seizure types, frequency, and EEG background
   - To assess for photosensitivity (exaggerated photic response is
     characteristic of NCL)
   - Scheduled: 11/06-08/2023, Womack AMC EEG Lab

3. OPHTHALMOLOGY — URGENT REFERRAL:
   - Comprehensive eye exam with dilated fundoscopy
   - Electroretinogram (ERG) — CRITICAL for NCL diagnosis
   - Visual evoked potentials (VEP)
   - OCT (optical coherence tomography) if patient can cooperate
   - Referred to Dr. Aisha Patel, Pediatric Ophthalmology, Duke Eye Center
     (Fayetteville)

4. LABORATORY STUDIES (ordered today):
   - Levetiracetam level (trough)
   - Comprehensive metabolic panel
   - Lactate and pyruvate (fasting, free-flowing venipuncture — critical
     for accurate measurement)
   - Ammonia
   - Uric acid
   - Plasma amino acids
   - Urine organic acids
   - Acylcarnitine profile
   - Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)
   - Lysosomal enzyme screen
   - CBC with differential
   - Ceruloplasmin (screen for Wilson disease)
   - Transferrin isoelectric focusing (CDG screen)

5. GENETICS REFERRAL:
   - Refer to Duke Genetics Clinic (Dr. Rachel Kim) for comprehensive
     genetic evaluation
   - Recommend: Whole exome sequencing (WES) OR comprehensive
     neurodegeneration/NCL gene panel (CLN1-14 at minimum)
   - Marked URGENT — progressive condition with potential treatment
     implications (enzyme replacement therapy, gene therapy trials)

6. MEDICATION ADJUSTMENT:
   - Continue levetiracetam 750mg BID
   - ADD: Clobazam (Onfi) 5mg PO BID — for additional broad-spectrum
     seizure control, particularly for myoclonic and absence seizures
   - Seizure rescue plan: continue diastat PRN
   - Monitor for sedation with clobazam addition

7. SWALLOWING EVALUATION:
   - Confirm SLP referral is active — modified barium swallow study needed
   - Aspiration precautions reviewed with family

8. FOLLOW-UP:
   - Return to neurology clinic after MRI and EEG completed — approximately
     6-8 weeks
   - I will personally review all results and contact family by phone if
     urgent findings arise
   - Discussed with mother: clinical suspicion for NCL. Explained what
     this means, that it requires confirmation through genetic testing,
     and that there are supportive treatments and emerging therapies.
     Mother tearful but expressed relief that "someone is finally looking
     at all of it." Spent 20 minutes in counseling and education.

Total visit time: 120 minutes (90 minutes face-to-face, 30 minutes
record review completed prior to appointment).

ICD-10 Codes:
  G31.9 — Degenerative disease of nervous system, unspecified
  G40.409 — Other generalized epilepsy, not intractable
  H47.20 — Unspecified optic atrophy
  R62.52 — Short stature (child)
  R47.1 — Dysarthria and anarthria
  R27.0 — Ataxia, unspecified
  F84.0 — Autistic disorder (HISTORICAL — diagnosis under active
           reconsideration; likely incorrect)

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING — MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST (3 TESLA)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Facility: Duke Radiology — Fayetteville Satellite
3100 Village Drive, Suite 200, Fayetteville, NC 28304
Date of Study: 10/15/2023
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS | DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 11 years 7 months
MRN: DUKE-4829175 | Accession: MR-2023-FC-09841
Ordering Physician: Samuel Park, MD — Womack AMC Neurology

EXAMINATION: MRI Brain with and without gadolinium contrast, 3 Tesla.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Progressive neurodegenerative process. Seizures.
Cerebellar ataxia. Visual decline. Suspected neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.
Please compare to all prior imaging.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain performed on a 3T
Siemens Prisma scanner. Sequences obtained: sagittal 3D T1 MPRAGE, axial
T2, axial FLAIR, axial DWI/ADC, axial SWI, coronal T2, post-contrast
axial and coronal T1. MR spectroscopy: single-voxel PRESS (TE 35 and
TE 144) from right parietal cortex and cerebellar vermis.

CONTRAST: Gadolinium-based contrast (Gadavist) 0.1 mmol/kg IV administered
without complication. Sedation with propofol administered by pediatric
anesthesiology team (patient unable to cooperate for unsedated scan).

COMPARISON: MRI brain age 3 (05/2015, report only — Virginia); MRI brain
age 6 (09/2018, report and DICOM images obtained from Riverside Radiology,
Columbus, GA); MRI brain age 9 (02/2021, report and DICOM images FINALLY
obtained from Piedmont Columbus Regional on 10/02/2023).

FINDINGS:

Cerebellum:
  - SEVERE cerebellar volume loss, diffuse, affecting both vermis and
    hemispheres. The cerebellar folia are markedly thinned with prominent
    interfolial fissures. Cerebellar volume is estimated at <50% of
    expected for age.
  - COMPARISON: The age-6 MRI, when reviewed in retrospect, shows SUBTLE
    cerebellar volume loss that was not identified in the original read
    (reported as "normal variant"). The age-9 MRI shows moderate cerebellar
    atrophy, which has SIGNIFICANTLY PROGRESSED on the current study.
  - The trajectory across the four imaging time points (ages 3, 6, 9, 12)
    demonstrates ACCELERATING cerebellar atrophy, particularly between
    ages 9 and 12.

Cerebral cortex:
  - Cerebral cortical atrophy has progressed, now rated as moderate. Most
    prominent in the PARIETAL and OCCIPITAL lobes. Sulci are diffusely
    widened. Cortical ribbon appears thinned, particularly in the parieto-
    occipital regions.
  - COMPARISON: The age-6 MRI showed mildly prominent ventricles (originally
    attributed to "normal variant") — in retrospect, this likely represented
    early cerebral volume loss. The age-9 MRI shows mild cortical volume
    loss. The current study shows clear progression.

Ventricles:
  - Lateral ventricles are prominently dilated (ex vacuo), reflecting
    parenchymal volume loss. Third ventricle mildly prominent. Fourth
    ventricle prominent relative to the decreased cerebellar volume.
  - No evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus. Ventricular enlargement is
    proportional to parenchymal loss.

Corpus callosum:
  - Diffuse thinning of the corpus callosum, most prominent in the body
    and splenium. This has progressed compared to the age-9 MRI, where
    early thinning was noted.

Hippocampal formations:
  - Bilateral hippocampal volume loss now apparent, not present on prior
    imaging. Hippocampi appear mildly atrophic with subtle T2 signal
    increase.

White matter:
  - T2/FLAIR: Subtle but definite periventricular and deep white matter
    signal abnormality, NEW since the age-9 study. Patchy areas of T2/FLAIR
    hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter, centrum semiovale,
    and posterior corona radiata bilaterally. This may represent
    demyelination or gliosis in the setting of neurodegeneration.

Thalami:
  - LOW T2 SIGNAL in the thalami bilaterally, particularly in the pulvinar
    nuclei. This finding was not present on prior imaging and may represent
    iron deposition or mineralization. This finding has been reported in
    certain NCL subtypes and in neurodegeneration with brain iron
    accumulation (NBIA). SWI sequences confirm susceptibility effect in
    these regions, consistent with paramagnetic material (likely iron or
    calcium).

Basal ganglia:
  - Normal signal. No volume loss. No mineralization.

Brainstem:
  - Mild volume loss of the pons and midbrain. Medulla appears preserved.
  - No signal abnormality.

Post-contrast imaging:
  - No abnormal enhancement. No mass lesion. No leptomeningeal enhancement.

MR Spectroscopy:
  Right parietal cortex (single voxel):
    - Decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak — consistent with neuronal
      loss/dysfunction
    - Mildly elevated myoinositol (mI) peak — consistent with gliosis
    - Choline (Cho) normal
    - Lactate: small inverted doublet at 1.3 ppm — MILDLY ELEVATED
      (consistent with either mitochondrial dysfunction or cellular stress
      in neurodegenerative process)
    - NAA/Cr ratio: 1.2 (low; normal >1.6)
    - mI/Cr ratio: 0.9 (elevated; normal <0.7)

  Cerebellar vermis (single voxel):
    - Markedly decreased NAA — consistent with severe neuronal loss
    - Elevated mI
    - NAA/Cr ratio: 0.8 (severely reduced)

IMPRESSION:

1. PROGRESSIVE AND ACCELERATING cerebellar and cerebral atrophy over a
   6-year imaging span, now severe in the cerebellum and moderate in the
   cerebrum. The pattern of volume loss — cerebellar predominant with
   parieto-occipital cortical involvement — is characteristic of neuronal
   ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL).

2. New periventricular and deep white matter T2/FLAIR signal abnormality
   since prior imaging, likely representing demyelination or gliosis
   secondary to the neurodegenerative process.

3. Low T2/SWI signal in the thalami bilaterally (pulvinar nuclei) — may
   represent iron deposition or mineralization. This finding has been
   described in some NCL subtypes, particularly CLN5 and CLN8.

4. MR spectroscopy demonstrates reduced NAA (neuronal loss) and elevated
   myoinositol (gliosis) in both sampled regions, with more severe changes
   in the cerebellum. Mild lactate elevation in the parietal cortex.

5. Progressive corpus callosum thinning and new hippocampal volume loss.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The progressive neurodegenerative imaging pattern is
most consistent with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or a mitochondrial
disorder. GENETIC TESTING IS ESSENTIAL for definitive diagnosis. Clinical
and imaging findings favor NCL over primary mitochondrial disease.

DIAGNOSTIC STUDY — CONTINUOUS VIDEO-EEG MONITORING (48-HOUR)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Facility: Womack Army Medical Center — Neurophysiology Laboratory
Date of Study: 11/06/2023 — 11/08/2023 (48 hours)
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS | DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 11 years 8 months
Ordering Physician: Samuel Park, MD
Interpreting Physician: Samuel Park, MD / Jennifer Liu, MD (EEG fellow)

CLINICAL INDICATION: Progressive neurodegenerative disease. Multiple seizure
types. Characterization of epilepsy syndrome. Assess for photosensitivity
(NCL suspected).

TECHNIQUE: Continuous digital video-EEG monitoring using the international
10-20 electrode placement system with additional T1/T2 electrodes. 48-hour
recording with continuous video and audio. Activation procedures: hypervent-
ilation (not performed — patient unable to cooperate), photic stimulation
(performed at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 Hz at multiple
intervals), and sleep recording (natural sleep captured — no sedation
administered for EEG). Anti-seizure medications continued at current doses
during recording (levetiracetam 750mg BID, clobazam 5mg BID).

BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:
  Wakefulness: The background is SEVERELY DISORGANIZED and DIFFUSELY SLOW.
  There is NO discernible posterior dominant rhythm (alpha rhythm). The
  predominant background frequency is 3-5 Hz theta and 1-3 Hz delta
  activity, moderate to high amplitude (100-200 microvolts), distributed
  diffusely but with maximal amplitude over posterior regions. No reactive
  or organized alpha activity is identified. There is no anterior-posterior
  gradient. Continuous irregular slow activity with intermixed sharp
  transients is present throughout the recording.

  Sleep: Sleep architecture is SEVERELY DISRUPTED. Sleep spindles and vertex
  waves are ABSENT. K-complexes are not identifiable. NREM sleep is
  characterized by continuous high-amplitude irregular delta activity with
  frequent epileptiform discharges (see below). REM sleep was not clearly
  identified during the recording.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
  Interictal: FREQUENT generalized epileptiform discharges are present
  throughout the recording, occurring in wakefulness and sleep.
    - Generalized 1.5-2.5 Hz spike-and-wave complexes: occurring in runs
      of 1-5 seconds duration, sometimes with associated subtle clinical
      change (behavioral arrest), sometimes subclinical. These are
      frontally predominant with diffuse field.
    - Generalized polyspike-and-wave discharges: 2-3 Hz, high amplitude
      (200-400 microvolts), occurring in brief bursts (0.5-2 seconds).
      These are frequently followed by myoclonic jerks (correlating with
      video).
    - Focal sharp waves: intermittent right posterior (P4, O2) sharp waves
      and sharp-slow complexes, occurring independently of the generalized
      discharges. These suggest a right posterior epileptogenic focus.
    - Multifocal sharp waves: occasional independent sharp waves from left
      temporal, right frontal, and bilateral parietal regions — consistent
      with diffuse cortical irritability.

ICTAL EVENTS CAPTURED:

  Total seizure events captured during 48-hour recording: 32

  Type 1 — Absence seizures (28 events):
    Clinical: Behavioral arrest lasting 5-20 seconds (mean 10 seconds).
    Subtle eyelid flutter in most events. Cessation of ongoing activity
    (hand-wringing stops). Brief post-ictal confusion (5-10 seconds).
    EEG: Generalized 2-2.5 Hz spike-and-wave discharge, onset and offset
    abrupt, duration correlating with clinical event. Maximum amplitude
    frontally. No focal onset identified — generalized from onset.
    Frequency: 28 events over 48 hours (average 14/day).

  Type 2 — Myoclonic seizures (3 events):
    Clinical: Brief (<1 second) bilateral symmetric myoclonic jerks of
    shoulders and arms, higher amplitude than the isolated interictal
    myoclonic jerks. One event resulted in arms flying upward. No loss
    of consciousness.
    EEG: Generalized high-amplitude polyspike discharge (200-400 uV)
    lasting 0.5-1.5 seconds, immediately preceding and time-locked to the
    myoclonic jerk. Generalized distribution with frontocentral maximum.
    These events are distinct from the more frequent isolated myoclonic
    jerks, which correlate with lower-amplitude polyspike fragments.

  Type 3 — Focal seizure with secondary generalization (1 event):
    Clinical (captured on video at 02:14 AM on night 2): Patient was in
    sleep. Onset: right head and eye deviation, followed by right arm
    tonic extension. After 15 seconds, bilateral tonic stiffening of all
    extremities, followed by bilateral clonic (rhythmic jerking) activity
    lasting approximately 30 seconds. Total seizure duration: 45 seconds.
    Post-ictal: unresponsive for approximately 3 minutes, then gradually
    returned to baseline sleep.
    EEG: Onset with rhythmic 8-10 Hz beta activity maximal at P4-O2
    (RIGHT POSTERIOR), evolving over 10 seconds to rhythmic 4-5 Hz
    theta, then spreading bilaterally with generalized 2-3 Hz rhythmic
    delta during the bilateral clonic phase. Post-ictal diffuse
    suppression for approximately 60 seconds followed by gradual return
    of background.

PHOTIC STIMULATION RESULTS:
  GROSSLY EXAGGERATED photic driving response. At LOW flash frequencies
  (1-3 Hz), photic stimulation elicited high-amplitude (300-500 uV)
  spike-and-wave discharges that were time-locked to the flash frequency.
  These discharges were associated with subtle myoclonic jerks of the
  eyelids and face. At 1 Hz, giant spike-and-wave complexes were elicited
  with each flash. At 2-3 Hz, runs of spike-and-wave activity were
  triggered that persisted for 2-3 seconds after cessation of the photic
  stimulus. At higher frequencies (>5 Hz), photic driving was present but
  without the exaggerated spike-and-wave response.

  This finding — an exaggerated photoparoxysmal response at LOW flash
  frequencies (1-3 Hz) — is CHARACTERISTIC of neuronal ceroid
  lipofuscinosis and is among the most specific EEG findings associated
  with NCL. It has been particularly well-described in CLN2, CLN5, and
  CLN6 disease.

INTERPRETATION:

1. SEVERELY ABNORMAL 48-hour continuous EEG.

2. Background: Severely disorganized and diffusely slow, consistent with
   diffuse cerebral dysfunction / encephalopathy. Absence of normal sleep
   architecture indicates severe thalamocortical network dysfunction.

3. Progressive myoclonic epilepsy with multiple seizure types:
   a. Absence seizures (28 events / 48 hours) — generalized spike-and-wave
   b. Myoclonic seizures (3 events) — generalized polyspike-and-wave
   c. Focal seizure with secondary generalization (1 event) — right
      posterior onset (P4-O2)
   d. Frequent interictal generalized and multifocal epileptiform discharges

4. The focal onset of the seizure originating from the right posterior
   region is consistent with the predominant parieto-occipital cortical
   atrophy observed on MRI.

5. GROSSLY EXAGGERATED LOW-FREQUENCY PHOTIC DRIVING RESPONSE — this
   finding is highly characteristic of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

6. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The combination of progressive myoclonic epilepsy
   with an exaggerated low-frequency photic response, in the setting of
   progressive neurodegeneration, cerebellar atrophy, and visual loss, is
   HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). This EEG
   pattern, combined with the clinical and imaging findings, constitutes
   a compelling case for NCL. Genetic confirmation is essential.

Referring Physician: Samuel Park, MD — Womack AMC Neurology
Examining Physician: Aisha Patel, MD — Pediatric Ophthalmology

REASON FOR REFERRAL: Progressive visual decline in setting of suspected
neurodegenerative disease (NCL). Pale optic discs noted on bedside exam.
Please evaluate with ERG.

HISTORY: 11-year-old male with progressive neurodegenerative condition
(suspected NCL, genetic confirmation pending). Parents report progressive
visual decline over the past 1-2 years — decreased reaching for objects,
does not track consistently, does not appear to recognize faces at distance.
No prior ophthalmologic evaluation on record.

EXAMINATION:

  Visual Acuity:
    Unable to perform standard optotype testing (Snellen, LEA symbols) due
    to cognitive and verbal limitations. Behavioral visual assessment:
    - Fixation: Inconsistent. Will briefly fixate on large (>6 cm),
      high-contrast objects held within 12 inches. Does not maintain
      fixation beyond 2-3 seconds.
    - Tracking: Severely impaired. Does not smoothly track objects across
      midline. Occasional saccadic movements toward large moving objects
      in central field.
    - Visual field assessment (confrontation): Blink to threat inconsistent
      bilaterally but appears more preserved in left hemifield. No reliable
      response to stimuli in right hemifield — concerning for RIGHT
      homonymous hemianopia or severe bilateral field constriction.
    - Estimated functional visual acuity: severely reduced, likely in the
      range of count fingers at best. Legal blindness criteria likely met.
    - CSM (Central, Steady, Maintained): Not central, not steady, not
      maintained — bilaterally.

  External exam: Normal. No ptosis. No strabismus at primary gaze.
  Extraocular movements: Full but with saccadic pursuit (consistent with
  neurological findings).
  Pupils: 4.5mm bilaterally in ambient light. Reactive to light but
  SLUGGISH — estimated 1-2+ bilaterally (markedly reduced for age). No
  relative afferent pupillary defect (symmetric involvement). The sluggish
  pupillary response is consistent with bilateral optic nerve and/or
  retinal dysfunction.
  Intraocular pressure (Tono-Pen): OD 14 mmHg, OS 13 mmHg — normal.
  Anterior segment (slit lamp — performed with patient in wheelchair):
  Cornea clear bilaterally. Anterior chamber deep and quiet. Iris normal.
  Lens clear bilaterally.

  DILATED FUNDOSCOPIC EXAMINATION (performed under sedation with oral
  chloral hydrate 50mg/kg due to poor cooperation):

    Optic discs:
    - BILATERAL OPTIC DISC PALLOR — significant and diffuse. Both discs
      appear waxy-pale with loss of the normal pink-orange coloration.
      Right disc slightly more pale than left. Disc margins are distinct
      (no edema). Cup-to-disc ratio 0.3 bilaterally (normal). Retinal
      nerve fiber layer appears thinned on clinical exam.
    - These findings are consistent with BILATERAL OPTIC ATROPHY.

    Macula:
    - Bilateral subtle but definite granular PIGMENTARY CHANGES in the
      macular region. Fine, stippled hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation
      creating a mottled appearance. A subtle concentric ring of
      hypopigmentation surrounding the fovea is noted bilaterally — this
      creates a BULL'S EYE MACULOPATHY pattern that is more evident on
      the right than the left.
    - The foveal reflex is ABSENT bilaterally.

    Retinal vessels: Mildly attenuated arterioles bilaterally, suggesting
    inner retinal compromise.
    Peripheral retina: Subtle granular pigmentary changes extending into
    the mid-periphery. No bone-spicule pigmentation (as seen in typical
    retinitis pigmentosa). No vitreous cells.

  ELECTRORETINOGRAM (ERG):
  Full-field ERG performed under sedation (as above) using DTL corneal
  electrodes, following ISCEV standard protocol.

    Dark-adapted (scotopic) responses:
    - 0.01 cd.s/m² (rod response): SEVERELY ATTENUATED. Rod b-wave
      amplitude: OD 18 uV, OS 22 uV (normal >80 uV). Implicit time:
      prolonged bilaterally.
    - 3.0 cd.s/m² (combined rod-cone response): SEVERELY ATTENUATED.
      a-wave: OD 25 uV, OS 28 uV (normal >100 uV). b-wave: OD 42 uV,
      OS 48 uV (normal >200 uV). b/a ratio preserved.
    - 3.0 cd.s/m² oscillatory potentials: Markedly reduced amplitude.

    Light-adapted (photopic) responses:
    - 3.0 cd.s/m² (cone response): SEVERELY ATTENUATED. a-wave: OD 8 uV,
      OS 10 uV (normal >30 uV). b-wave: OD 22 uV, OS 26 uV (normal
      >80 uV).
    - 30 Hz flicker: SEVERELY ATTENUATED. Amplitude: OD 10 uV, OS 13 uV
      (normal >50 uV). Implicit time: prolonged.

    ERG Summary: SEVERELY ABNORMAL — grossly attenuated scotopic and
    photopic responses bilaterally, indicating combined ROD AND CONE
    DYSFUNCTION. The degree of attenuation (>75% reduction from normal
    in all parameters) indicates severe, widespread photoreceptor
    degeneration.

  OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) — limited study (patient sedated,
  alignment challenging):
    Central foveal thickness: OD 185 um, OS 190 um (reduced; normal
    ~230-260 um for age).
    Peripapillary RNFL thickness: OD average 52 um, OS average 56 um
    (severely reduced; normal >85 um for age).
    Outer nuclear layer: Diffusely thinned bilaterally — consistent with
    photoreceptor loss.
    Ellipsoid zone: Disrupted and discontinuous throughout the macula
    bilaterally — indicates photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment
    junction damage.

ASSESSMENT:

1. SEVERE RETINAL DEGENERATION with combined rod and cone photoreceptor
   dysfunction, bilateral, as demonstrated by grossly abnormal ERG and
   OCT findings.
2. BILATERAL OPTIC ATROPHY — secondary to retinal degeneration and/or
   primary optic nerve involvement by the neurodegenerative process.
3. BULL'S EYE MACULOPATHY — bilateral, consistent with lysosomal storage
   disease-related retinal degeneration.
4. Functional vision: SEVERELY IMPAIRED. Likely meets criteria for legal
   blindness (best corrected visual acuity estimated at count fingers or
   worse bilaterally).

CLINICAL CORRELATION:
In the clinical context of progressive neurodegeneration, epilepsy,
cerebellar atrophy, and the EEG findings reported by Dr. Park, these
ophthalmologic findings are MOST CONSISTENT WITH NEURONAL CEROID
LIPOFUSCINOSIS (NCL). The triad of:
  (a) progressive retinal degeneration with rod-cone dysfunction,
  (b) bull's eye maculopathy, and
  (c) optic atrophy
is characteristic of NCL, particularly the late-infantile variants (CLN5,
CLN6, CLN7, CLN8). The severity of retinal involvement and the pattern
of combined rod-cone dysfunction distinguish this from other causes of
pediatric retinal degeneration.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Genetic confirmation of NCL diagnosis is essential.
2. Low-vision services referral — orientation and mobility training,
   adaptive devices.
3. Certification for visual impairment/blindness for educational and
   support services.
4. Follow-up in 6 months to monitor progression.
5. Report sent to Dr. Samuel Park and Dr. Lisa Washington.

ENCOUNTER NOTE — NEUROLOGY FOLLOW-UP / RESULTS REVIEW AND GENETICS
COORDINATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of Service: 12/18/2023
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS
DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 11 years 9 months | Sex: Male
Ordering Physician: Samuel Park, MD
Visit Type: Follow-Up — Results Review (45 minutes)

REASON FOR VISIT:
Review of completed diagnostic workup. Coordination of genetics referral.

RESULTS SUMMARY:

1. MRI Brain 3T (10/15/2023): Progressive and accelerating cerebellar and
   cerebral atrophy. New white matter signal abnormality. Thalamic T2
   hypointensity (possible iron/mineral deposition). MR spectroscopy
   showing neuronal loss and gliosis. Pattern most consistent with NCL.
   (Full report in chart — see above.)

2. 48-hour Video-EEG (11/06-08/2023): Progressive myoclonic epilepsy with
   multiple seizure types (absence 28/48hr, myoclonic 3/48hr, focal with
   secondary generalization 1/48hr). Severely abnormal background.
   EXAGGERATED LOW-FREQUENCY PHOTIC RESPONSE — characteristic of NCL.
   (Full report in chart — see above.)

3. Ophthalmology (11/20/2023): Severe retinal degeneration (rod and cone).
   Bilateral optic atrophy. Bull's eye maculopathy. ERG severely abnormal.
   Consistent with NCL. (Full report in chart — see above.)

4. Laboratory results (drawn 09/12/2023):
   - Levetiracetam level: 32.1 mcg/mL (therapeutic)
   - CMP: Na 139, K 4.3, Cl 101, CO2 23, BUN 10, Cr 0.4, Glucose 88,
     Ca 9.4, Albumin 3.6, AST 28, ALT 22 — all within normal limits
   - FASTING LACTATE: 3.1 mmol/L (HIGH — normal <2.0 mmol/L). NOTE: This
     is consistent with the reportedly elevated lactate at age 9 (2.8
     mmol/L per mother's records) that was not available in the transferred
     medical file. The persistent mild lactic acidemia supports
     mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be PRIMARY (mitochondrial
     disease) or SECONDARY (as seen in NCL and other storage disorders
     where lysosomal/cellular dysfunction impairs mitochondrial function).
   - Pyruvate: 0.15 mmol/L (high normal). Lactate/pyruvate ratio: 20.7
     (mildly elevated; normal <20).
   - Ammonia: 28 umol/L (normal)
   - Uric acid: 3.8 mg/dL (normal)
   - Plasma amino acids: Mildly elevated alanine (consistent with lactic
     acidemia). No other significant abnormalities.
   - Urine organic acids: Mildly elevated lactate and Krebs cycle
     intermediates. No characteristic organic aciduria pattern.
   - Acylcarnitine profile: Normal. No evidence of fatty acid oxidation
     defect.
   - VLCFA: Normal (rules out X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy).
   - Lysosomal enzyme screen (plasma): PPT1 and TPP1 not specifically
     included in this panel — will need to be ordered separately through
     genetics. Other lysosomal enzymes in normal range.
   - CBC: WBC 6.8, Hgb 11.8, Plt 232 — normal.
   - Ceruloplasmin: 28 mg/dL (normal — rules out Wilson disease).
   - Transferrin IEF: Normal pattern (rules out CDG).

CLINICAL SYNTHESIS:

The clinical triad of:
  (1) Progressive neurodegenerative disease with seizures (progressive
      myoclonic epilepsy),
  (2) Progressive visual loss with retinal degeneration (rod-cone
      dystrophy, optic atrophy, bull's eye maculopathy), and
  (3) Progressive cerebellar and cerebral atrophy on imaging

is CLASSIC for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Additionally, the
exaggerated low-frequency photic response on EEG and the thalamic
T2 hypointensity on MRI are supportive findings that further narrow the
differential toward NCL.

I have discussed these findings extensively with the family today. Both
parents were present (SGT Reeves was granted emergency leave for this
appointment). I explained:
  - The clinical evidence very strongly suggests a diagnosis of NCL
    (Batten disease)
  - Definitive diagnosis requires genetic confirmation
  - The most likely subtypes based on age of onset and phenotype are CLN5
    or CLN6, though CLN7 and CLN8 remain in the differential
  - There are emerging therapies including gene therapy trials for some
    NCL subtypes
  - Regardless of subtype, comprehensive supportive care is essential

Mother was tearful but stated she felt "relief that someone is finally
putting this together." Father was quiet during much of the discussion,
then asked: "Could this have been found sooner?" I answered honestly that
in retrospect, the progressive nature of Eli's condition could have been
identified earlier if the full trajectory had been evaluated, and that the
original ASD diagnosis likely delayed recognition of the neurodegenerative
process. I acknowledged the role that fragmented records and multiple
relocations played in the diagnostic delay.

GENETICS REFERRAL STATUS:
Referral to Duke Genetics Clinic (Dr. Rachel Kim) has been placed. Current
wait time for new patient consultation: approximately 6 months. I have
written a letter supporting EXPEDITED evaluation and have specifically
requested:
  1. Comprehensive NCL gene panel (CLN1-14) OR
  2. Whole exome sequencing (WES) — preferred, as this will also evaluate
     for other neurodegenerative conditions in the differential

I have been informed by the genetics scheduling office that TRICARE may
require prior authorization for WES. I am proactively preparing a medical
necessity letter (see attached) to accompany the prior authorization
request.

MEDICATION UPDATE:
  - Continue levetiracetam 750mg BID
  - Continue clobazam 5mg BID
  - Seizure frequency has improved modestly with dual therapy (per mother,
    approximately 8-12 observable events daily on levetiracetam alone, now
    approximately 5-8 daily with addition of clobazam). However, the EEG
    shows frequent subclinical discharges, indicating that the true seizure
    burden is higher than clinically observed.
  - Discussed addition of a third agent if seizures worsen. Options include
    valproic acid (good for myoclonic epilepsy but hepatotoxicity risk) or
    zonisamide. Will reassess at next visit.

PLAN:
1. Genetics referral — expedited request submitted.
2. Medical necessity pre-authorization for WES — letter prepared.
3. Continue current medications.
4. Low-vision services referral (per ophthalmology recommendation).
5. Continue PT, OT, SLP services.
6. Nutritional support — continue PediaSure, monitor swallowing function.
7. Follow-up neurology in 3 months.
8. Family provided with contact information for Batten Disease Support and
   Research Association (BDSRA) — bdsra.org.
9. Social work referral for family support services, respite care, and
   EFMP coordination.

INSURANCE CORRESPONDENCE — PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DENIAL AND APPEAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== TRICARE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DETERMINATION ===
Date: 07/02/2024
Reference #: PA-2024-TC-4481920
Beneficiary: REEVES, ELI MARCUS | DEERS ID: 1098745632
Sponsor: SGT Marcus Reeves, USA
Requesting Provider: Samuel Park, MD — Womack AMC
Requested Service: Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), CPT 81415/81416
Testing Laboratory: GeneDx, Inc.

DETERMINATION: DENIED — NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY

RATIONALE:
The requested genetic testing panel (whole exome sequencing, CPT 81415 and
81416) is not medically necessary per TRICARE plan guidelines and clinical
policy bulletin CPB-2023-GEN-047 (Genetic and Genomic Testing).

Per policy, whole exome sequencing may be considered medically necessary when:
  (a) The patient has a phenotype strongly suggestive of a genetic etiology,
      AND
  (b) A specific clinical diagnosis has not been established after standard
      clinical evaluation, AND
  (c) Single-gene or targeted panel testing has been performed and is
      non-diagnostic, OR a specific single-gene test is not available for
      the suspected condition.

In this case, criterion (c) has not been met. The clinical documentation
indicates a suspected diagnosis of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL).
Targeted gene panel testing for NCL (CLN1-14) is available and is a more
cost-effective initial approach than whole exome sequencing. ALTERNATIVE:
Single-gene testing or a targeted NCL gene panel may be considered if a
specific diagnosis is suspected. The requesting provider may resubmit with
a request for targeted panel testing, or may appeal this determination.

Appeal rights: You may appeal this determination within 90 days. Appeals
should be submitted in writing to TRICARE Appeals, P.O. Box 7031,
Camden, SC 29020, or faxed to (844) 555-0199.

=== APPEAL LETTER — DR. SAMUEL PARK ===

Date: 07/18/2024
To: TRICARE Appeals Department
Re: Appeal of Prior Authorization Denial — PA-2024-TC-4481920
Patient: Eli Marcus Reeves, DOB 03/15/2012, DEERS ID 1098745632

Dear TRICARE Medical Director:

I am writing to appeal the denial of prior authorization for whole exome
sequencing (WES) for my patient, Eli Reeves, a 12-year-old male with a
progressive, undiagnosed neurodegenerative condition.

I respectfully submit that the denial rationale reflects a misunderstanding
of the clinical situation and the appropriate diagnostic approach for this
patient. I address each point below:

REGARDING THE RECOMMENDATION FOR SINGLE-GENE OR TARGETED PANEL TESTING:

The denial letter suggests that "single-gene testing or a targeted NCL gene
panel" is an appropriate alternative to WES. I disagree for the following
reasons:

1. While the clinical presentation is MOST CONSISTENT with neuronal ceroid
   lipofuscinosis (NCL), the differential diagnosis includes multiple other
   neurodegenerative conditions (mitochondrial disorders, NBIA,
   gangliosidoses, Niemann-Pick type C, and others). Single-gene testing
   is NOT appropriate in this case because the clinical presentation is
   consistent with multiple possible NCL subtypes (CLN1 through CLN14, each
   caused by a different gene) AS WELL AS numerous other neurodegenerative
   conditions. Sequential single-gene testing would require testing 14+
   genes individually, at a cost and time burden that far exceeds WES.

2. Even a targeted NCL panel (CLN1-14) may be insufficient. If NCL is
   ruled out, additional panels would be required (mitochondrial
   genome, NBIA genes, lysosomal storage genes, etc.). WES evaluates all
   of these simultaneously and is BOTH MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND MORE
   TIME-EFFICIENT than sequential panel testing in the setting of an
   undiagnosed neurodegenerative condition.

3. Whole exome sequencing is the STANDARD OF CARE for undiagnosed
   neurodegenerative conditions per the American College of Medical
   Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines (2023). The ACMG position
   statement on genomic sequencing in pediatric patients states that WES
   (or whole genome sequencing) should be considered a first-tier test
   for patients with: (a) intellectual disability or developmental delay
   of suspected genetic etiology, (b) multiple congenital anomalies, or
   (c) suspected genetic conditions where the differential diagnosis
   includes multiple genes. This patient meets criteria (a) and (c).

4. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. This patient has had symptoms for over 10 years
   with a diagnostic delay due to misdiagnosis and fragmented care across
   multiple states. His condition is progressive and deteriorating. Rapid
   definitive diagnosis may identify targeted therapeutic options including
   enzyme replacement therapy (available for CLN2) or gene therapy clinical
   trials (ongoing for CLN3, CLN5, CLN6). Every month of additional
   diagnostic delay represents further irreversible neurological decline.

CLINICAL SUMMARY SUPPORTING MEDICAL NECESSITY:

This 12-year-old male has a 10-year history of progressive neurological
decline initially misdiagnosed as autism spectrum disorder. His clinical
features include:
  - Progressive cognitive and motor regression since age 2-3
  - Progressive myoclonic epilepsy (multiple seizure types, refractory)
  - Progressive cerebellar and cerebral atrophy (documented on serial MRI)
  - Progressive retinal degeneration with rod-cone dysfunction (ERG
    severely abnormal)
  - Bilateral optic atrophy
  - Exaggerated low-frequency photic response on EEG (characteristic of NCL)
  - Persistently elevated lactate
  - Growth failure

Despite evaluation by multiple specialists in three states over 12 years,
he does NOT have a definitive genetic diagnosis. The etiology is UNKNOWN.
WES is the most appropriate, efficient, and cost-effective path to
diagnosis.

I strongly urge reconsideration of this denial. I am available to discuss
this case by phone at any time.

Sincerely,

GENETICS CONSULTATION — NEW PATIENT (COMPREHENSIVE)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of Service: 12/02/2024
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS
DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 12 years 9 months | Sex: Male
MRN: DUKE-4829175
Insurance: TRICARE Prime
Referring Provider: Samuel Park, MD — Womack AMC Neurology
Consulting Provider: Rachel Kim, MD, PhD — Clinical Genetics
Genetic Counselor: Lauren Ashford, MS, CGC
Visit Type: New Patient — Comprehensive Genetics Consultation
Visit Duration: 120 minutes (90 minutes face-to-face; 30 minutes chart
review and documentation)

CC: Dr. Samuel Park (Neurology), Dr. Lisa Washington (PCP)

REASON FOR REFERRAL:
Progressive neurodegenerative condition, suspected neuronal ceroid
lipofuscinosis (NCL), for genetic confirmation and counseling.

I. RECORDS REVIEWED:

I have reviewed the following records prior to and during this consultation:
  1. Dr. Samuel Park, Neurology — complete records including initial
     consultation (09/2023), MRI report (10/2023), EEG report (11/2023),
     follow-up notes and laboratory results
  2. Dr. Aisha Patel, Ophthalmology — consultation with ERG (11/2023)
  3. Dr. Lisa Washington, PCP — records from 06/2022 to present
  4. Dr. Amy Huang, PCP (Columbus, GA) — partial records
  5. Dr. Adwoa Osei, Neurology (Columbus, GA) — partial, poor quality fax
  6. MRI reports from ages 3, 6, 9, and 12
  7. Cape Fear Valley MC ER record (07/2023)
  8. TRICARE denial and appeal documentation
  9. Mother's personal record binder — comprehensive review performed
     during today's visit

This represents the most complete record review performed for this patient
to date. For the first time, I have been able to simultaneously access
records from all three states and from the mother's personal documentation.

II. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Eli is a 12-year-9-month-old mixed-race (Black/White) male with a
progressive neurodegenerative condition that has been symptomatic since
approximately age 2-3 years. He was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder
at age 3.5, a diagnosis that remained unchallenged until age 9 (when
Dr. Osei first questioned it) and was formally reconsidered at age 11.5
(when Dr. Park identified the progressive neurodegenerative trajectory).

The clinical course is characterized by:
  - Normal development until approximately 12-18 months
  - Developmental plateau followed by progressive regression beginning
    at approximately 18-24 months
  - Progressive loss of motor function: independent ambulation → AFOs →
    wheelchair (complete by age 9-10)
  - Progressive loss of language: short sentences (age 4-5) → single words
    (age 7-8) → 4-5 words (age 10) → essentially non-verbal (age 12)
  - Progressive seizure disorder: staring spells from age 2-3 (diagnosed
    as epilepsy at age 9). Multiple seizure types including absence,
    myoclonic, and focal with secondary generalization. Currently on
    dual antiseizure therapy with partial control.
  - Progressive visual decline: first noted by parents approximately
    age 10-11. ERG severely abnormal. Bull's eye maculopathy. Optic
    atrophy.
  - Progressive cerebellar atrophy documented on serial MRI (ages 6-12)
  - Growth failure: declining percentiles across all parameters
  - Dysphagia requiring diet modification

The patient currently requires total care for all activities of daily
living. He is wheelchair-bound, essentially non-verbal (rare single
words), has severely impaired vision, and has multiple daily seizures.

III. FAMILY HISTORY AND PEDIGREE:

A three-generation pedigree was constructed during this visit with the
assistance of both parents.

MATERNAL LINEAGE (Denise Reeves, nee Thomas):
  Mother: Denise Reeves (Thomas), age 36. Healthy. African American.
  No significant medical history. No known consanguinity.
  Maternal grandmother: Dorothy Thomas, age 64. African American.
  Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus. No neurological symptoms.
  Living.
  Maternal grandfather: Robert Thomas, age 66 (estimated). African
  American. Hypertension. No neurological symptoms. Living.
  Maternal aunts/uncles: 2 maternal aunts (ages 38 and 32), both
  healthy. 1 maternal uncle (age 40), healthy. All have children (5
  maternal cousins total, ages 4-16) — all reported healthy and
  developmentally typical.
  No known family history of seizures, developmental delay,
  neurological disease, or early death on maternal side.

PATERNAL LINEAGE (Marcus Reeves):
  Father: Marcus Reeves, SGT, USA, age 38. Caucasian (European
  American). History of migraines (onset age 20, infrequent, managed
  with OTC medication). Otherwise healthy. No known consanguinity.
  Paternal grandmother: Gloria Reeves (deceased). Caucasian. Reportedly
  developed "memory problems" in her early 60s. Per family, she became
  "forgetful" and "confused" and required assistance with daily
  activities by age 65. She was never formally evaluated by a
  neurologist per family report — "the family just took care of her."
  She passed away at age 71 of "pneumonia" (aspiration pneumonia per
  death certificate, obtained by family at my request). ANNOTATION:
  The pattern described — early-onset dementia with progression to
  dependence and death from aspiration pneumonia — is nonspecific but
  COULD represent: (a) early-onset Alzheimer disease, (b) heterozygous
  carrier manifestation of a lysosomal storage disorder (some NCL
  carrier genotypes have been associated with increased risk of
  neurodegenerative disease in later life, though this is not well-
  established for all subtypes), or (c) an unrelated neurodegenerative
  condition. This warrants further consideration in the context of
  genetic results.
  Paternal grandfather: William Reeves, age 74 (estimated). Caucasian.
  Coronary artery disease (CABG age 68). No neurological symptoms.
  Living.
  Paternal aunts/uncles: 1 paternal uncle (age 42), healthy. His
  children (2 paternal cousins, ages 12 and 9) — both reported healthy.
  1 paternal aunt (age 35), healthy, no children.

CONSANGUINITY: Denied. Parents are of different ethnic backgrounds
(African American and European American). No known shared ancestry.

PREGNANCY/BIRTH HISTORY:
  Eli is the only child of Denise and Marcus Reeves. He was born at 39
  weeks gestational age via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Birth weight
  7 lbs 4 oz (3.3 kg, 40th percentile). Length 20 inches (50.8 cm,
  50th percentile). APGAR scores 8 at 1 minute, 9 at 5 minutes.
  Neonatal course unremarkable. Newborn hearing screen: passed
  bilaterally. Newborn metabolic screen: normal (Virginia — does not
  include NCL enzyme screening). No complications.
  Pregnancy: Uncomplicated. Prenatal care adequate. No infections, no
  medications, no substance use. No gestational diabetes or
  preeclampsia.
  Prior pregnancies: None. No history of miscarriage or stillbirth.

IV. PHYSICAL / DYSMORPHOLOGY EXAMINATION:

  Vitals:
    Height: 57.2 inches (145.3 cm) — 3rd percentile for age (↓ from 5th)
    Weight: 68 lbs (30.8 kg) — <3rd percentile for age (↓ from 3rd)
    BMI: 14.6 kg/m² — 3rd percentile
    HC: 53.1 cm — 30th percentile
    HR: 90 bpm | BP: 100/62 mmHg | SpO2: 97% RA

  General: Thin, small-for-age male in wheelchair. Minimal spontaneous
  movement. Drooling. Intermittent vocalizations.

  Dysmorphology assessment:
    - Craniofacial: No dysmorphic features. Normocephalic. Normal
      facies. No coarsening of facial features (argues against MPS or
      some other storage disorders with facial coarsening). Normal ear
      position and morphology. Palate intact, high-arched.
    - Hands: Long, slender fingers. No brachydactyly or arachnodactyly.
      Single palmar crease absent. Nails: normal, no dystrophy.
    - Skin: No neurocutaneous stigmata (no cafe-au-lait spots, no
      ash-leaf spots, no shagreen patches). No angiokeratomas (argues
      against Fabry disease). Skin is intact, mild sacral erythema from
      wheelchair positioning.
    - Hair: Normal texture and distribution.
    - Skeletal: Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis. Joint contractures at
      ankles and developing at knees. No dysostosis multiplex (argues
      against MPS).
    - Abdomen: Soft, non-distended. NO hepatosplenomegaly (this is an
      important negative finding — hepatosplenomegaly would suggest
      Niemann-Pick C, Gaucher, or other storage disorders with visceral
      involvement. Its absence narrows the differential toward NCL,
      which typically does NOT have visceral involvement).
    - Neurological: Consistent with Dr. Park's detailed examination.
      I additionally note: absence of cherry-red spot on fundoscopy
      (argues against GM2 gangliosidosis / Tay-Sachs / Sandhoff).

  OVERALL DYSMORPHOLOGY IMPRESSION: No dysmorphic features. The absence
  of facial coarsening, hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal dysplasia, and
  angiokeratomas narrows the differential significantly and is
  CONSISTENT with NCL, which is a "non-dysmorphic" neurodegenerative
  storage disorder.

V. REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC DATA:

  Imaging: [See detailed MRI reports in chart — summarized in Dr. Park's
  notes. Progressive cerebellar > cerebral atrophy, white matter changes,
  thalamic mineralization. Pattern consistent with NCL.]

  Electrophysiology: [See detailed EEG report — progressive myoclonic
  epilepsy with exaggerated low-frequency photic response, characteristic
  of NCL.]

  Ophthalmology: [See Dr. Patel's report — severe retinal degeneration,
  rod-cone dysfunction, optic atrophy, bull's eye maculopathy. Consistent
  with NCL.]

  Metabolic studies: Persistently elevated lactate (2.8 at age 9, 3.1 at
  age 12). Mildly abnormal MR spectroscopy. Otherwise non-diagnostic
  metabolic workup.

VI. LITERATURE REVIEW AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:

I have performed a focused literature review to inform this evaluation.
The clinical features most relevant to the differential diagnosis are:
  (1) Age of onset: 18-24 months (regression); clinical diagnosis at age 3
  (2) Progressive course affecting cognition, motor, language, vision
  (3) Seizure types: absence, myoclonic, focal — progressive myoclonic
      epilepsy
  (4) Imaging: Cerebellar > cerebral atrophy, thalamic T2 hypointensity
  (5) ERG: Severely abnormal (rod-cone dystrophy)
  (6) EEG: Exaggerated low-frequency photic response
  (7) No dysmorphic features, no hepatosplenomegaly

Based on these features, the differential diagnosis is:

  1. NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS (NCL) — HIGHEST CLINICAL SUSPICION
     The clinical phenotype is classic for late-infantile NCL. Based on the
     age of onset (2-3 years) and the specific constellation of features,
     the most likely subtypes are:

     a. CLN5 disease (Finnish variant late infantile NCL):
        - Typical onset age 4-7 years (but reported as early as 2-3)
        - Progressive motor and cognitive decline, seizures (including
          myoclonic), visual loss, cerebellar atrophy
        - Caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in CLN5 (soluble
          lysosomal protein)
        - Autosomal recessive. Originally described in Finland but now
          recognized worldwide.
        - The age of onset in this patient (2-3 years) is somewhat earlier
          than the classic CLN5 description, but early-onset cases have
          been reported, particularly with certain severe mutations.

     b. CLN6 disease (variant late infantile NCL):
        - Typical onset age 18 months — 8 years
        - Very similar phenotype to CLN5
        - Caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in CLN6 (ER membrane
          protein)
        - Autosomal recessive. Reported worldwide.

     c. CLN7 disease (Turkish variant late infantile NCL):
        - Caused by MFSD8 gene variants. Similar phenotype. Less common.

     d. CLN8 disease:
        - Caused by CLN8 gene variants. Can present as late infantile or
          as "Northern epilepsy" (milder form).

     e. Late-onset CLN2:
        - Caused by TPP1 gene variants. Classic form presents at 2-4
          years but late-onset forms exist. TPP1 enzyme activity testing
          can screen for this.

  2. Mitochondrial disorder — LOWER SUSPICION given overall phenotype
     - Elevated lactate is nonspecific and can be secondary in NCL
     - Absence of characteristic MRI pattern for mitochondrial disease
       (no basal ganglia involvement, no brainstem lesions)
     - Progressive retinal degeneration is atypical for most mitochondrial
       disorders (except Kearns-Sayre, which has different features)

  3. NBIA (Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation) — LOW SUSPICION
     - Thalamic T2 hypointensity could suggest iron; however, the
       characteristic "eye of the tiger" sign in globus pallidus is absent
     - Retinal degeneration not typical for most NBIA subtypes

  4. GM2 gangliosidosis (late-onset Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff) — LOW
     - No cherry-red spot. Late-onset forms possible but typically have
       different presentation.

  5. Niemann-Pick Type C — LOW
     - No hepatosplenomegaly. Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy not noted.

VII. ASSESSMENT:

This patient has a progressive neurodegenerative condition that has been
symptomatic since approximately age 2-3 years. The clinical features —
progressive cognitive and motor regression, seizures (absence, myoclonic,
and focal), cerebellar atrophy, retinal degeneration, and optic atrophy —
are most consistent with Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis.

Based on the age of onset and phenotypic features, the most likely subtypes
are CLN5 (Finnish variant late infantile) or CLN6 (variant late infantile),
though CLN7 and CLN8 cannot be excluded on clinical grounds alone.

This patient has been misdiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder for
approximately 10 years. While some behavioral features at the time of
initial evaluation overlapped with ASD diagnostic criteria (limited speech,
repetitive hand movements, reduced social engagement), the progressive
course clearly distinguishes this from a primary neurodevelopmental
condition. Autism spectrum disorder, by definition, is not characterized
by progressive loss of motor function, progressive seizure disorder,
cerebellar atrophy, or retinal degeneration. The features attributed to
ASD — the hand-wringing stereotypies, the social withdrawal, the
communication limitations — were, with high probability, early
manifestations of the neurodegenerative process.

This represents a significant diagnostic delay — approximately 10 years
from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of the genetic workup that
will likely yield a definitive diagnosis. This delay was contributed to by
multiple factors including: (1) diagnostic anchoring on the ASD diagnosis,
(2) fragmented care across three states due to military relocations,
(3) incomplete records transfer, (4) failure of multiple providers to
recognize the PROGRESSIVE nature of the condition as inconsistent with
ASD, and (5) insurance barriers to genetic testing. While the disease
itself has no cure at present, earlier diagnosis would have provided:
accurate prognostic information, access to supportive services, potential
enrollment in clinical trials at an earlier disease stage, and avoidance
of years of inappropriate ASD-directed therapies.

VIII. PLAN:

1. GENETIC TESTING (insurance now approved — appeal granted 10/28/2024):
   a. Whole exome sequencing (WES) — GeneDx, Inc.
      - Trio analysis: patient + both parents (to determine inheritance
        pattern and variant phasing)
      - Priority analysis: NCL gene panel (CLN1-14) with reflex to full
        exome if NCL panel negative
      - Both parents consented and blood drawn today for parental samples
      - Patient blood drawn today
      - Estimated turnaround: 12-16 weeks

   b. Enzyme activity assays (send-out to Batten Disease Diagnostic and
      Clinical Research Center at University of Rochester):
      - PPT1 (palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1) — enzyme deficient in
        CLN1 disease
      - TPP1 (tripeptidyl peptidase 1) — enzyme deficient in CLN2
        disease
      - These enzyme assays can rapidly rule in or rule out CLN1 and CLN2,
        which have available enzyme replacement therapies (cerliponase alfa
        for CLN2)
      - Results expected in 2-4 weeks

   c. Skin biopsy for electron microscopy:
      - Performed today (3mm punch biopsy, left upper arm, local
        anesthesia)
      - Specimens sent to Duke Pathology EM laboratory
      - If NCL is present, EM will show characteristic storage material
        inclusions:
        * Curvilinear profiles (CLN2, CLN5, CLN6)
        * Fingerprint bodies (CLN5, CLN6, CLN8)
        * Granular osmiophilic deposits (CLN1)
        * Rectilinear profiles (CLN3)
      - The pattern of inclusions can help narrow the NCL subtype while
        awaiting genetic results
      - Results expected in 4-6 weeks

   d. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing panel — ordered as secondary
      consideration given persistently elevated lactate. If WES identifies
      a nuclear gene cause, mitochondrial sequencing may not be needed.

2. GENETIC COUNSELING:
   - Extensive genetic counseling provided by Lauren Ashford, MS, CGC
     during today's visit (45 minutes).
   - Topics covered: autosomal recessive inheritance, carrier status,
     implications for future family planning, cascade testing for
     extended family members if pathogenic variants identified.
   - Both parents understand that if Eli has NCL:
     * Both parents are obligate carriers (one variant each)
     * Each future pregnancy would have a 25% chance of being affected
     * Carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis would be available
   - Family provided written materials on NCL/Batten disease.

3. Follow-up appointment scheduled in 4 weeks for enzyme assay results,
   and in 12-16 weeks for WES results.

LABORATORY RESULTS — ENZYME ASSAYS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date Resulted: 01/08/2025
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS | DOB: 03/15/2012
MRN: DUKE-4829175
Ordering Physician: Rachel Kim, MD, PhD
Performing Laboratory: Batten Disease Diagnostic and Clinical Research
  Center, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY

ENZYME ACTIVITY ASSAYS — DRIED BLOOD SPOT (DBS):

  PPT1 (Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1):
    Result: 8.2 nmol/hr/mg protein
    Reference range: 5.0 — 25.0 nmol/hr/mg protein
    Interpretation: NORMAL
    Clinical significance: Normal PPT1 activity RULES OUT CLN1 disease
    (infantile NCL / Santavuori-Haltia disease).

  TPP1 (Tripeptidyl Peptidase 1):
    Result: 42.6 nmol/hr/mg protein
    Reference range: 30.0 — 100.0 nmol/hr/mg protein
    Interpretation: NORMAL
    Clinical significance: Normal TPP1 activity RULES OUT CLN2 disease
    (late infantile NCL / Jansky-Bielschowsky disease). This also means
    that enzyme replacement therapy with cerliponase alfa (Brineura) is
    NOT indicated, as this therapy is specific to CLN2.

SKIN BIOPSY — ELECTRON MICROSCOPY REPORT:
Date Resulted: 01/22/2025
Performing Laboratory: Duke University Medical Center — Electron Microscopy
  Laboratory, Department of Pathology
Pathologist: Dr. Thomas Nakamura, MD — Ultrastructural Pathology

SPECIMEN: Skin punch biopsy, left upper arm (3mm), received 12/02/2024.

LIGHT MICROSCOPY: Unremarkable skin biopsy. Epidermis and dermis
within normal limits. Eccrine sweat glands present and unremarkable on
H&E staining.

ELECTRON MICROSCOPY:

  Lymphocytes (peripheral blood buffy coat, submitted concurrently):
    Numerous MEMBRANE-BOUND CYTOPLASMIC INCLUSIONS identified within
    lymphocytes. The inclusions measure 0.5-2.0 micrometers in diameter
    and contain:
    - CURVILINEAR PROFILES: The predominant pattern. Dense, curved
      lamellae arranged in stacks, with a characteristic "fingerprint"-
      like periodicity of approximately 5 nm. These are typical of the
      storage material found in several NCL subtypes.
    - FINGERPRINT BODY PROFILES: Admixed with the curvilinear profiles.
      These show parallel curved lines with a wider periodicity
      (~8-10 nm) resembling dermatoglyphic ridges.
    - The MIXED curvilinear and fingerprint pattern is characteristic of
      CLN5 and CLN6 disease.

  Eccrine sweat gland epithelium:
    Similar membrane-bound inclusions identified within sweat gland
    epithelial cells, confirming widespread storage material
    accumulation. The inclusions contain predominantly curvilinear
    profiles.

  Fibroblasts:
    Rare inclusions identified. Less prominent than in lymphocytes.

  Neurons (not available in this specimen — skin biopsy).

INTERPRETATION:
Numerous curvilinear and fingerprint profile inclusions identified in
lymphocytes and sweat gland epithelium. These findings are DIAGNOSTIC
for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). The mixed curvilinear /
fingerprint pattern is most commonly associated with CLN5 or CLN6
disease, though it has also been reported in CLN8. Correlation with
genetic testing is recommended for definitive subtype classification.

detection algorithm. Variants were classified according to ACMG/AMP 2015
guidelines.

RESULTS:

  PRIMARY FINDING:

  TWO PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IDENTIFIED IN THE CLN5 GENE

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Gene:     CLN5 (OMIM *608102)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  Variant 1:
    Nucleotide change:  c.291+1G>A
    Protein change:     N/A (splice site variant)
    Variant type:       Splice donor site variant
    Zygosity:           Heterozygous
    Inheritance:        PATERNALLY INHERITED (confirmed in father's sample)
    Classification:     PATHOGENIC (Class 5)

    Evidence for pathogenicity:
    - PVS1: Null variant in a gene where loss of function is a known
      mechanism of disease
    - PM2: Absent from gnomAD population database (not observed in
      >250,000 alleles)
    - PM3: Detected in trans with a second pathogenic variant in a
      patient with a phenotype consistent with CLN5 disease
    - PP4: Patient's phenotype is highly specific for CLN5 disease
    - Literature: This variant has been previously reported in two
      unrelated families with CLN5 disease (Xin et al., 2010; Mancini
      et al., 2015). The c.291+1G>A variant disrupts the canonical GT
      splice donor site of intron 2 of the CLN5 gene, predicted to
      result in aberrant splicing and loss of functional protein.

  Variant 2:
    Nucleotide change:  c.726G>A
    Protein change:     p.Trp242Ter (p.W242*)
    Variant type:       Nonsense (stop-gain) variant
    Zygosity:           Heterozygous
    Inheritance:        MATERNALLY INHERITED (confirmed in mother's sample)
    Classification:     PATHOGENIC (Class 5)

    Evidence for pathogenicity:
    - PVS1: Null variant (premature stop codon) in a gene where loss
      of function is a known mechanism of disease
    - PM2: Rare in gnomAD (allele frequency 0.000008, 2 heterozygous
      carriers in African/African American population, no homozygotes)
    - PM3: Detected in trans with a second pathogenic variant in a
      patient with a phenotype consistent with CLN5 disease
    - PP4: Patient's phenotype is highly specific for CLN5 disease
    - Literature: The c.726G>A (p.Trp242Ter) variant introduces a
      premature termination codon at position 242 of the 407-amino-acid
      CLN5 protein. This variant has been reported in one prior case of
      CLN5 disease in a patient of African American ancestry (Kousi et
      al., 2012). The truncated protein is predicted to be nonfunctional
      and subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

  Compound heterozygous configuration: CONFIRMED by trio analysis. The
  c.291+1G>A variant was identified in the father's sample (heterozygous
  carrier), and the c.726G>A variant was identified in the mother's sample
  (heterozygous carrier). The proband carries both variants, one on each
  allele (compound heterozygous). This is consistent with autosomal
  recessive inheritance of CLN5 disease.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  SECONDARY FINDINGS:

  Mitochondrial DNA analysis (performed concurrently):
    One variant of uncertain significance (VUS) identified:
    m.4216T>C (MT-ND1, p.Tyr304His)
    - This is a known polymorphism present in ~2% of the European
      population. It has been reported in some studies as associated with
      Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) as a "secondary" variant,
      but its pathogenicity is uncertain, particularly in the context
      of a confirmed CLN5 diagnosis. This variant is NOT considered to
      be the cause of the patient's condition and is likely an incidental
      finding.

  No additional pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in
  other genes associated with neurodegenerative disease, epilepsy, or
  intellectual disability.

  ACMG Secondary Findings (V3.1): No reportable secondary findings in
  the 78 ACMG recommended genes.

INTERPRETATION:

Whole exome sequencing identified two pathogenic variants in the CLN5
gene in compound heterozygous configuration. These findings are
DIAGNOSTIC for CLN5 disease (Finnish variant late infantile neuronal
ceroid lipofuscinosis; OMIM #256731).

CLN5 disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused
by biallelic loss-of-function variants in the CLN5 gene, which encodes a
soluble lysosomal protein of incompletely understood function (likely
involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular trafficking). Disease
results in accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin storage material in neurons
and other cell types, leading to progressive neurodegeneration.

The two identified variants — a splice site variant (c.291+1G>A,
paternal) and a nonsense variant (c.726G>A, maternal) — are both predicted
to result in complete loss of CLN5 protein function, consistent with the
severe phenotype observed in the patient.

Parental carrier testing confirms that each parent carries one pathogenic
variant in the heterozygous state, as expected for autosomal recessive
inheritance.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. This result confirms the diagnosis of CLN5 disease.
  2. Genetic counseling for the family regarding recurrence risk and
     reproductive options.
  3. Carrier testing should be offered to at-risk relatives.
  4. Clinical management per published guidelines for NCL/Batten disease.
  5. Consider referral for clinical trial eligibility (gene therapy
     trials for CLN5 are in development).

GENETICS FOLLOW-UP — DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION AND COUNSELING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of Service: 04/14/2025
Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS
DOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 13 years 1 month | Sex: Male
MRN: DUKE-4829175
Provider: Rachel Kim, MD, PhD — Clinical Genetics
Genetic Counselor: Lauren Ashford, MS, CGC
Visit Type: Follow-Up — Results Disclosure and Counseling (90 minutes)

Both parents present. Father again obtained emergency leave for this
appointment.

DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMED:

  CLN5 NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS (BATTEN DISEASE)
  OMIM #256731
  Also known as: Finnish variant late infantile NCL; CLN5 disease

  Confirmed by:
  - Whole exome sequencing: compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in
    CLN5 (c.291+1G>A, paternal; c.726G>A, p.Trp242Ter, maternal)
  - Skin biopsy EM: curvilinear and fingerprint body inclusions
    (diagnostic for NCL)
  - Enzyme assays: normal PPT1 and TPP1 (ruling out CLN1 and CLN2)
  - Clinical phenotype: progressive neurodegeneration, myoclonic epilepsy,
    visual loss, cerebellar atrophy — classic for CLN5

DIAGNOSTIC TIMELINE:

This diagnosis was achieved approximately 12 YEARS after symptom onset
(first concerns at age 2; confirmed genetic diagnosis at age 13) and
10 YEARS after the initial misdiagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD diagnosed at age 3.5; CLN5 confirmed at age 13).

The ASD diagnosis is hereby formally REMOVED from the problem list.
The patient's condition is fully explained by CLN5 disease. All features
previously attributed to ASD — including stereotypic hand movements,
limited social engagement, restricted communication, and behavioral
regression — are manifestations of the progressive neurodegenerative
process.

GENETIC COUNSELING — RESULTS SESSION:

The following topics were discussed in detail with both parents:

1. DIAGNOSIS EXPLANATION:
   CLN5 disease is a rare, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder
   belonging to the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL / Batten disease
   family). It is caused by deficiency of the CLN5 protein, which results
   in accumulation of storage material (ceroid lipofuscin) in neurons
   throughout the brain and retina, leading to progressive cell death.
   There are an estimated 50-100 known living patients with CLN5 disease
   worldwide. The condition is progressive.

2. PROGNOSIS:
   CLN5 disease follows a progressive course. Eli's current clinical
   status — wheelchair dependence, near-complete loss of speech, severe
   visual impairment, refractory epilepsy — is consistent with the
   expected disease trajectory. Discussed with family that the disease
   continues to progress, with further decline in neurological function
   expected. Life expectancy is variable; reported survival in CLN5
   disease ranges from the mid-teens to the early 30s, depending on the
   severity of the genetic variants and the quality of supportive care.
   Cause of death is typically aspiration pneumonia or complications of
   prolonged immobility.

   Both parents were emotional during this discussion. Mother stated: "I
   have known something was terribly wrong since he was 2 years old. I
   just wanted someone to believe me." Father asked again: "If they had
   tested him earlier, could they have done anything?" I explained that
   while there is no cure for CLN5, earlier diagnosis could have:
     - Avoided years of inappropriate ASD-directed therapy
     - Provided accurate prognostic information earlier
     - Enabled enrollment in clinical trials at earlier disease stages
       when more neurological function was preserved
     - Facilitated family planning decisions
     - Reduced the emotional burden of diagnostic uncertainty

3. CARRIER STATUS AND FAMILY PLANNING:
   - Father (Marcus Reeves): Confirmed carrier of CLN5 c.291+1G>A.
     Carrier status has no known health implications (carriers are
     typically asymptomatic).
   - Mother (Denise Reeves): Confirmed carrier of CLN5 c.726G>A.
     Carrier status has no known health implications.
   - For each future pregnancy: 25% chance of affected child (CLN5
     disease), 50% chance of carrier (asymptomatic), 25% chance of
     non-carrier. Prenatal diagnosis is available through CVS or
     amniocentesis. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-M) is available
     with IVF.
   - Mother asked about this. She stated they had considered having
     another child before the diagnosis. She and her husband will discuss
     and follow up.

4. CASCADE TESTING:
   - Paternal relatives: Father's siblings (1 brother, 1 sister) should
     be offered carrier testing for c.291+1G>A. If they are carriers,
     their reproductive partners could also be tested.
   - Maternal relatives: Mother's siblings (2 sisters, 1 brother) should
     be offered carrier testing for c.726G>A.
   - Letters prepared for family members explaining the genetic finding
     and recommending carrier testing through their own healthcare
     providers.
   - NOTE regarding paternal grandmother (Gloria Reeves, deceased):
     The paternal grandmother's "early-onset dementia" remains of
     uncertain relationship to CLN5. She was an obligate carrier of the
     c.291+1G>A variant (having passed it to the father). While CLN5
     carriers are generally asymptomatic, there is emerging but
     inconclusive literature suggesting that heterozygous carriers of
     some NCL variants may have a modestly increased risk of
     neurodegenerative disease in later life. This cannot be confirmed
     or refuted without a sample from the grandmother (unavailable).
     This was discussed with the family as a possibility but not a
     certainty.

5. AVAILABLE THERAPIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS:
   a. Enzyme replacement therapy: Cerliponase alfa (Brineura) is FDA-
      approved for CLN2 disease only. NOT applicable to CLN5.
   b. Gene therapy:
      - A phase 1/2 gene therapy trial for CLN5 disease (AAV-mediated
        intrathecal delivery of CLN5 gene) is being conducted at
        University College London (UCL) and Nationwide Children's
        Hospital (Columbus, OH). Current enrollment criteria require
        patients to have some residual motor and cognitive function.
        Given Eli's advanced disease stage, he may not meet inclusion
        criteria, but a referral for evaluation has been submitted.
      - A phase 1 gene therapy trial for CLN6 disease (Brineura Gene
        Therapy, NCT02725580) at Nationwide Children's — not applicable
        to CLN5 but mentioned for family's awareness.
   c. Supportive care: Comprehensive palliative and supportive care is
      the current standard for CLN5 disease. This includes seizure
      management, nutritional support (including gastrostomy when
      indicated), PT/OT, vision services, pain management, and
      psychosocial support for the family.

MOTHER'S TIMELINE SUMMARY — HANDWRITTEN, TRANSCRIBED

 handwriting described by Dr. Park as "meticulous and organized")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    ELI'S MEDICAL TIMELINE
                 Written by Denise Reeves, his mom
              (started 2019, updated continuously)
              Last updated: February 2026

I am writing this because no doctor has ever had the full picture.
Every time we move, records get lost. Every new doctor starts over.
I am tired of starting over. This is everything.

AGE 0-1 (2012-2013):
  - March 15, 2012: Eli born, Portsmouth Naval Medical Center, VA.
    Healthy baby. 7 lbs 4 oz. Everything normal.
  - Hit all his milestones on time. Smiled, rolled over, sat up. I have
    videos of everything. He was a happy, normal baby.
  - First words around 12 months — "mama," "dada," "ball."
  - Pediatrician: Dr. James Whitfield, Hampton, VA. Said he was perfect.

AGE 1-2 (2013-2014):
  - Walking was late. He didn't walk until 26 months. Dr. Whitfield said
    "boys are slower, don't worry." But I was worried.
  - His words stopped growing. He had about 20 words by age 2 and that
    was it. No new words were coming in.
  - Started doing this thing with his hands — wringing them together,
    over and over. I thought it was just a habit.
  - I told Dr. Whitfield I was worried. He said wait and see.

AGE 2-3 (2014-2015):
  - SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I knew it. He was not progressing. Other kids
    his age were running and talking in sentences. Eli was still on
    single words and walking like he might fall over any second.
  - The staring spells started. He would just STOP and stare into space
    for 5-10 seconds. His eyes would flutter. Then he'd come back like
    nothing happened. I told Dr. Whitfield. He said "kids daydream."
    I KNEW this was not daydreaming.
  - Dr. Whitfield finally referred us to developmental pediatrics.
    6-MONTH WAIT.
  - MRI done at age 3 (05/2015) — read as "normal for age."

AGE 3-4 (2015-2016):
  - Age 3.5: Saw Dr. Whitfield at the developmental pediatrics clinic
    in Norfolk. [Note from Denise: I can't remember the exact doctor's
    name at the clinic, it was a woman.] She said AUTISM. Said his hand
    wringing was "stimming," his limited speech was "expressive language
    delay consistent with ASD," his not looking at people was "social
    deficits."
  - I asked about the staring spells. SHE SAID IT WAS PART OF AUTISM.
    I asked if they should do a brain wave test. She said it wasn't
    needed.
  - I KNEW something was wrong beyond autism. He was LOSING things, not
    just delayed. But she was the expert, so I tried to believe her.
  - Started ABA therapy. Eli hated it. He cried every session. The
    therapists said that was normal at first.
  - Dr. Whitfield says autism. I asked about the staring spells. He said
    it's part of autism. I KNEW something was wrong.

AGE 4-5 (2016-2017):
  - ABA therapy for a year now. NO PROGRESS. None. The therapist said
    he was "resistant to treatment." I said he wasn't resistant — he
    couldn't DO it. There's a difference.
  - HE WAS GETTING WORSE. At age 4 he could button his shirt. By age 5
    he couldn't anymore. That's not autism. That's losing skills.
  - Staring spells getting more frequent. Happening every day now.
  - Walking more unsteady. Tripping a lot. Toe walking worse.

AGE 5-7 (2017-2019):
  - Marcus got orders to Fort Benning, GA. We moved summer 2017.
  - New pediatrician: Dr. Amy Huang, Columbus, GA. She was nice. She
    looked at the records we brought (I brought everything I had).
  - She saw "ASD" in the chart and that was that. I told her about the
    regression, the staring spells, the losing skills. She said
    "regression can happen in autism, especially with anxiety."
  - He was NOT anxious. He was SICK.
  - Age 6: Dr. Huang referred to neurology (Dr. Kevin Chen). ONE visit.
    He ordered an MRI. MRI said "mildly prominent ventricles, normal
    variant." I asked about comparing to the old MRI from Virginia. He
    said he didn't have the old one. I ASKED THEM TO GET IT. Nobody did.
  - Dr. Chen said: "Consistent with ASD. Continue current therapies."
    ONE visit. That was it.
  - By age 7, Eli needed help walking. His gait was terrible. He was
    falling almost every day. The school was calling me to pick him up
    because he fell in the hallway.

AGE 7-9 (2019-2021):
  - Age 8: Got AFOs (ankle braces). Orthopedist (Dr. Torres) said
    "neuromuscular." But when I asked what that meant, he said it was
    just a word for his muscles being weak from the autism. AUTISM
    DOESN'T DO THIS.
  - PT started. The physical therapist — God bless her — she wrote a
    note saying "this doesn't look like typical ASD motor involvement."
    She recommended neurology re-evaluation. I KEPT THAT NOTE. It's in
    this binder.
  - Age 8-9: Staring spells 2-3 per day. Night jerking started. I
    started using a baby monitor so I could watch him sleep. I recorded
    videos of the jerking on my phone. DOCTORS NEED TO SEE THESE.
  - Speech down to mostly single words. Could still say some 2-word
    things ("want eat," "no more").
  - Age 9: FINALLY saw a neurologist who actually listened. Dr. Adwoa
    Osei. She took one look at him and said "this needs a full workup."
    She ordered an EEG and an MRI.
  - EEG: ABNORMAL. Seizure activity. She diagnosed epilepsy. Started
    Keppra. I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE STARING SPELLS SINCE HE WAS 2.
    SEVEN YEARS. Seven years of seizures that nobody would test for
    because they said it was autism.
  - MRI age 9: Showed his CEREBELLUM WAS SHRINKING. It wasn't on the
    old MRI. Or actually maybe it was and nobody caught it. Dr. Osei
    said she needed to compare to the old MRIs but she couldn't get
    them. SOUND FAMILIAR??
  - Labs: Lactate was high. 2.8. Normal is under 2. Dr. Osei said this
    was important.
  - Dr. Osei FINALLY says this is not autism. FINALLY. She said it's
    something genetic. Something degenerative. She wanted to do genetic
    testing. She mentioned "Batten disease" as one possibility.
  - But then we have to move. AGAIN.
  - Marcus got orders to Fort Liberty, NC. We had to go. Dr. Osei said
    she would send all her records and that the new neurologist should
    continue the workup. She hugged me when we left. She said she was
    sorry nobody caught it sooner.

AGE 10-12 (2022-2024):
  - Moved to Fort Liberty, June 2022. New everything. New doctors, new
    schools, new everything.
  - DR. OSEI'S RECORDS NEVER MADE IT. The EEG, the MRI, the lactate
    results, her notes about genetic testing — NONE of it was in the
    file that transferred. I couldn't believe it. I called Columbus.
    They said they sent everything. THEY DIDN'T.
  - New pediatrician: Dr. Lisa Washington. She tried. She really did.
    But she had almost nothing to work with. She only had 2 years of
    Dr. Huang's notes and the orthopedic stuff. She didn't have any of
    the neurology records.
  - Eli was in a wheelchair full-time now. 5-8 seizures a day.
    Barely talking.
  - Dr. Washington put in an urgent neurology referral. FOUR MONTH
    WAIT. I called TRICARE over and over. Four months.
  - Then Eli had a big seizure, 3 minutes, we had to call 911. That's
    when they finally expedited the neurology appointment.
  - September 2023: Dr. Samuel Park, neurology, Womack Army Medical
    Center. He is the first doctor who sat down with my binder and
    actually READ it. All of it. He spent 2 hours. He said things I
    had been waiting TEN YEARS to hear. He said this was never autism.
    He said it was a brain disease. He said the word I had been
    researching for years: Batten disease.
  - He ordered everything. MRI, EEG, eye tests, blood work, genetics
    referral. He actually COMPARED the MRIs from over the years. He
    could see the brain shrinking.
  - The EEG showed what the one in Ohio showed, plus more. The eye
    doctor said Eli's retinas were dying. It all pointed to one thing.
  - Genetics referral: 6-month wait. Then INSURANCE DENIED the genetic
    test. DENIED IT. They said it wasn't necessary. My son is dying and
    the test to find out WHY is not necessary??
  - Dr. Park and Dr. Washington both wrote appeal letters. Took 4
    months for the appeal. Finally approved October 2024.

AGE 12-14 (2024-2026):
  - December 2024: Genetics at Duke (Dr. Rachel Kim). She is thorough.
    She ordered the genetic test, plus skin biopsy, plus enzyme tests.
  - January 2025: Skin biopsy showed the storage material. She said
    that CONFIRMED it was Batten disease even before the genetic test
    came back.
  - March 2025: THE GENETIC TEST CAME BACK. CLN5. Batten disease.
    Two mutations — one from me, one from Marcus. We are both carriers.
    We had no idea.
  - It took 12 years. TWELVE YEARS. He was 2 when I first said
    something was wrong. He was 13 when we got the answer.
  - Now I need to know: what can be done? What could have been done?
    Are there treatments? Are there trials? And if we have another
    baby, what are the chances?
  - I am bringing Eli to a new developmental pediatrics clinic. Someone
    who can look at THE WHOLE PICTURE and help us figure out what
    happens next.

MOTHER'S LETTER TO NEW DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICS CLINIC
(Tab 8 of binder — typed, printed, 1 page, dated March 2026)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                          March 1, 2026

To Whom It May Concern:

My name is Denise Reeves. My son Eli is 14 years old. He has been sick
since he was about 2.

We have seen 8 doctors across 3 states in 12 years. We moved 3 times
because my husband is in the Army. Every time we moved, records got lost.
Every time we started over with a new doctor, they only saw a piece of the
picture. Nobody ever saw all of it.

Eli was told he had autism when he was 3 and a half years old. I never
thought that was the whole story. He was getting WORSE, not just different.
He lost skills. He stopped talking. He stopped walking. He started having
seizures. For years, I told doctors that something else was going on. For
years, they told me it was just the autism, that regression can happen, that
I should be patient.

I was not wrong. My son does not have autism. He has Batten disease — CLN5.
A genetic brain disease that has been destroying his brain since he was a
toddler. We got this diagnosis in March 2025, when he was 13 years old.
TWELVE YEARS after I first told his pediatrician that something was wrong.

Nobody connected the dots because nobody ever had all the records at the
same time. The MRIs were done at different hospitals in different states
and nobody compared them until he was 12. The EEG that showed seizures was
done at age 9 but the results didn't transfer when we moved. The blood test
that showed something abnormal was done at age 9 but no doctor in North
Carolina ever saw those results. The genetic testing that should have been
done at age 9 didn't happen because we had to move, and then when it was
finally ordered at age 12, the insurance company denied it, and it took
another year to get approved.

I carry this binder everywhere. It has everything. The MRIs, the blood work,
the therapy reports, the school records, everything. I have spent 12 years
collecting these papers because the medical system could not keep track of
my son's records across state lines.

This binder is 487 pages. It is more complete than any hospital chart. I am
not saying that to brag. I am saying that because it is a failure of the
system that a mother with a high school diploma has a more complete medical
record than the hospitals that treated her son.

PLEASE look at all of it. PLEASE.

We finally have genetic testing results that show Eli has CLN5 Batten
disease. But it took 12 years. I want someone to look at the whole picture
and tell me: what do we do now? What treatments are available? Are there
clinical trials he can be in? What is going to happen to him? How do we
give him the best quality of life we can?

And I need someone to answer the question I have been carrying for years:
could this have been found sooner? Because I think it could have. I have
been saying something was wrong since he was 2 years old. The staring
spells that turned out to be seizures — I reported those at age 2. The
skill loss that turned out to be neurodegeneration — I reported that at
age 4. The brain shrinkage that turned out to be progressive — it was
probably already starting on the MRI at age 6, but nobody compared it to
the earlier one. The abnormal blood work at age 9 — nobody in North
Carolina even knew about it.

I am not angry at any one doctor. I am angry at a system that let my son
fall through the cracks for 12 years. I am angry that every time we moved,
we started over. I am angry that insurance denied the test that could have
given us answers a year earlier. I am angry that the word "autism" in his
chart made every doctor stop looking for anything else.

But mostly, I am tired. And I need help.

Eli is 14 now. He is in a wheelchair. He cannot talk. He can barely see.
He has seizures every day. He needs me for everything. And I will be here
for everything. But I need a team. I need someone who will look at all of
this and help us make a plan.

Thank you for your time. Please read the binder.

Sincerely,

Denise Reeves

appear normal. IMPRESSION: Normal brain MRI for age."

RETROSPECTIVE RE-READ (Dr. Margaret Choi, MD — January 2026):
"In retrospect, with the knowledge of confirmed NCL diagnosis and with
the benefit of comparison to subsequent studies, there is a question of
very subtle cerebellar vermis volume loss. The cerebellar folia appear
minimally prominent compared to normative references for a 3.5-year-old.
However, this finding is within the range of normal variation at this age,
and I cannot state with confidence that it represents early pathology. The
1.5T field strength and limited protocol (no volumetric sequences) further
constrain retrospective analysis. The cerebral hemispheres appear truly
normal at this time point. I would NOT have called this abnormal even on
prospective review with a high index of suspicion.

REVISED IMPRESSION: Equivocal. Possible very subtle cerebellar vermis volume
loss, but within the range of normal variation. No definitive abnormality
can be identified at this age on this study."

------------------------------------------------------------------------
STUDY 2 — MAY 22, 2018 (AGE 6 YEARS 2 MONTHS)
Nationwide Children's Hospital, 1.5T
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL READ (Dr. Patricia Kwon, MD — Pediatric Neuroradiology):
"Brain MRI without and with contrast. The ventricles are mildly prominent,
which may represent a normal variant. The cerebral parenchyma demonstrates
normal signal. Myelination is complete and age-appropriate. No restricted
diffusion. No abnormal enhancement. The posterior fossa structures are
unremarkable. No mass or midline shift. IMPRESSION: Mildly prominent
ventricles, likely a normal variant. No acute intracranial abnormality.
Clinical correlation recommended."

RETROSPECTIVE RE-READ (Dr. Margaret Choi, MD — January 2026):
"Compared to the age-3 study from Richmond, there is now DEFINITE cerebellar
volume loss that was not appreciated on the original interpretation. The
cerebellar vermis and hemispheres demonstrate diffuse volume loss with
prominence of the cerebellar fissures that is clearly beyond normal
variation for a 6-year-old. This is unequivocally worse compared to the
age-3 study.

The 'mildly prominent ventricles' noted in the original read likely
represent early ex-vacuo ventricular dilatation secondary to beginning
brain parenchymal volume loss, rather than a benign normal variant. There
is subtle widening of the cerebral sulci in the parieto-occipital regions
that was not commented upon in the original report.

CRITICAL NOTE: Had the prior study from age 3 been available for comparison
at the time of this reading, the progressive nature of the cerebellar
volume loss would very likely have been identified. The original read was
performed without any comparison study, and the changes, while definite in
retrospect, could be overlooked as a variant on a single time-point reading
at 1.5T without specific clinical concern for neurodegeneration.

It should also be noted that the clinical history provided to radiology at
the time of this study was 'Autism spectrum disorder, rule out structural
abnormality.' A clinical history of developmental REGRESSION or suspected
seizures would have heightened the radiologist's scrutiny for subtle
volume loss.

REVISED IMPRESSION: Definite cerebellar atrophy, progressive compared to
age-3 study. Early cerebral volume loss. Findings consistent with a
neurodegenerative process. This is the earliest time point at which a
definitive imaging abnormality can be identified."

------------------------------------------------------------------------
STUDY 3 — APRIL 9, 2021 (AGE 9 YEARS 1 MONTH)
Nationwide Children's Hospital, 3.0T
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL READ (Dr. Ravi Mehta, MD — Pediatric Neuroradiology):
"Brain MRI without and with contrast, with MR spectroscopy. Comparison
is made to the prior study from May 2018.

FINDINGS: There is significant interval progression of cerebellar atrophy
compared to the prior study from approximately 3 years ago. The cerebellar
vermis and hemispheres are markedly diminished in volume with prominent
cerebellar fissures and enlargement of the fourth ventricle. New cerebral
cortical volume loss is now apparent, most pronounced in the parietal and
occipital lobes, with diffuse sulcal prominence and mild ex-vacuo
ventricular enlargement. The lateral ventricles are more prominent than
on the prior study. There is subtle T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular
white matter.

The corpus callosum appears mildly thinned compared to age-matched
normative data. The thalami demonstrate borderline T2 hypointensity.
No restricted diffusion. No abnormal enhancement.

MR Spectroscopy (single voxel, parietal white matter): Mildly reduced
NAA/Cr ratio (1.8, normal >2.0), suggesting neuronal loss. Mildly
elevated myo-inositol, suggesting gliosis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Significant progressive cerebellar atrophy with new cerebral cortical
   volume loss, worse since prior study from 2018.
2. Findings are highly concerning for a neurodegenerative process.
3. Recommend urgent clinical correlation and consideration of metabolic
   and genetic evaluation.
4. MR spectroscopy findings support neuronal loss with gliosis."

RETROSPECTIVE COMMENT (Dr. Margaret Choi, MD — January 2026):
"The original read by Dr. Mehta was accurate and appropriately alarming.
This study demonstrated unequivocal progression and correctly identified
the neurodegenerative pattern. Dr. Mehta's recommendation for metabolic
and genetic evaluation was appropriate. This was the point at which the
imaging findings alone demanded a neurodegenerative workup. The
progression from Study 2 to Study 3 over a 3-year interval is dramatic
and leaves no room for ambiguity."

------------------------------------------------------------------------
STUDY 4 — MARCH 20, 2024 (AGE 12 YEARS 0 MONTHS)
Womack Army Medical Center, 3.0T
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL READ (Dr. Colin Baker, MD — Neuroradiology):
"Brain MRI without and with contrast, with MR spectroscopy. Comparison
is made to outside study from April 2021 (Nationwide Children's Hospital).

FINDINGS: There is severe generalized brain atrophy that has progressed
markedly since the prior study. The cerebellum is severely atrophic with
near-complete loss of cerebellar hemispheric and vermian volume. The
fourth ventricle is widely patent. Moderate-to-severe cerebral atrophy is
present with diffuse cortical thinning, sulcal prominence, and ex-vacuo
ventricular dilatation. The parietal and occipital lobes are
disproportionately affected.

The thalami demonstrate definite bilateral T2 hypointensity, which is a
recognized feature of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and other storage
disorders. The corpus callosum is markedly thinned, particularly in the
body and splenium. Diffuse T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is present in the
periventricular and deep white matter bilaterally, consistent with
demyelination or gliosis.

MR Spectroscopy (single voxel, parietal white matter): Markedly reduced
NAA/Cr ratio (1.2), significantly worsened from 2021, indicating
progressive neuronal loss. Elevated myo-inositol peak. Mildly elevated
choline, suggesting active demyelination.

No restricted diffusion to suggest acute injury. No abnormal enhancement.

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe progressive cerebellar and cerebral atrophy with significant
   interval worsening since 2021.
2. Bilateral thalamic T2 hypointensity — characteristic of neuronal
   ceroid lipofuscinosis.
3. Marked corpus callosum thinning.
4. Diffuse white matter signal abnormality consistent with secondary
   demyelination/gliosis.
5. MR Spectroscopy confirms progressive neuronal loss.
6. Findings are consistent with the known diagnosis of CLN5 Neuronal
   Ceroid Lipofuscinosis."

------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERALL COMPARISON CONCLUSION (Dr. Margaret Choi, MD)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Serial imaging spanning 8.5 years (age 3.5 to age 12) demonstrates
relentless progressive neurodegeneration with a cerebello-predominant
pattern characteristic of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis. The earliest
DEFINITIVE imaging abnormality was present at age 6 years 2 months
(Study 2) but was not recognized on the original interpretation due to:
(1) lack of prior comparison imaging, (2) clinical history provided to
radiology that emphasized autism rather than regression, and (3) the
subtlety of the findings at 1.5T without volumetric analysis.

The age-3.5 study (Study 1) is equivocal in retrospect. Even with the
benefit of hindsight and confirmed diagnosis, I cannot definitively
identify pathology at that time point, though very subtle early cerebellar
changes may have been present.

By Study 3 (age 9), the findings were unambiguous and the original
reader appropriately identified the neurodegenerative pattern. By Study 4
(age 12), the imaging demonstrates severe end-stage neurodegeneration
with the classic NCL features including thalamic T2 hypointensity.

PATTERN SUMMARY:
  - Cerebellar atrophy:    Earliest (definitive by age 6)
  - Cerebral atrophy:      Detected by age 9, severe by age 12
  - Thalamic involvement:  Borderline age 9, definitive age 12
  - Corpus callosum:       Thinned by age 12
  - White matter disease:  Periventricular changes by age 9, diffuse by 12
  - Spectroscopy decline:  NAA/Cr from ~normal (assumed) → 1.8 → 1.2

This pattern is consistent with published imaging progression data for
CLN5 disease (Mole and Williams, 2001; Jadav et al., 2014; Lonnqvist
et al., 2022).

Lactate 2.8 mmol/L (reference <2.2) and lactate-to-pyruvate ratio of 33
(reference <25) were mildly elevated at age 9. This was noted in Dr. Osei's
chart but the result was not followed up with repeat testing or
mitochondrial evaluation due to the family's relocation before the
follow-up appointment. The elevated L:P ratio can be seen in NCL due to
secondary mitochondrial dysfunction in affected neurons and is a
recognized but non-specific finding. This abnormal result was NOT present
in the records transferred to North Carolina.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ORDERED EARLIER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a retrospective analysis of testing gaps:

1. ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (EEG):
   - SHOULD have been ordered: Age 2-3 (when staring spells first reported)
   - ACTUALLY first ordered: Age 9 (by Dr. Osei, Neurology)
   - DELAY: Approximately 6-7 years
   - IMPACT: EEG at age 2-3 may have shown epileptiform activity or
     background slowing inconsistent with ASD alone. This would have
     redirected the diagnostic evaluation years earlier.

2. COMPREHENSIVE METABOLIC/GENETIC PANEL:
   - SHOULD have been ordered: Age 5-6 (when clear developmental regression
     was documented)
   - ACTUALLY first ordered: Age 9 (partial panel), Age 12 (enzyme studies,
     WES)
   - DELAY: Approximately 4-6 years for metabolic studies; 6-7 years for
     genetic testing
   - IMPACT: Whole exome sequencing was available clinically from
     approximately 2015 onward. If ordered at age 6 when regression was
     documented, diagnosis could have been made by age 6-7.

3. LYSOSOMAL ENZYME PANEL:
   - SHOULD have been ordered: Age 6-9 (once neurodegenerative process
     suspected on imaging)
   - ACTUALLY first ordered: Age 12
   - DELAY: 3-6 years
   - NOTE: Lysosomal enzyme panel alone would NOT have identified CLN5
     (no specific enzyme assay for CLN5), but it would have narrowed the
     differential and prompted earlier genetic testing.

4. REPEAT LACTATE / MITOCHONDRIAL WORKUP:
   - Elevated lactate (2.8) and L:P ratio (33) at age 9 were not repeated
     or followed up.
   - Should have prompted: Repeat fasting lactate, consideration of
     mitochondrial DNA testing, or referral to metabolic genetics.
   - Result was lost in the transfer to North Carolina.

NOTE: Birth parameters at 50th percentile bilaterally. Subtle downward
drift during infancy — clinically insignificant at each individual visit
but notable in retrospect as a very early trend.

NOTE: Gradual decline from ~50th to ~28th percentile for height and
weight. Head circumference declining faster (50th → 26th), suggesting
early secondary microcephaly from decreased brain growth. BMI declining
reflects poor weight gain relative to height. These trends were not
flagged by any provider — each individual measurement was within "normal
limits."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHOOL AGE (AGES 6-9)

NOTE: Continued decline across all parameters. Head circumference now at
15th percentile — sequential decline from 50th at birth represents
secondary (acquired) microcephaly consistent with progressive brain
atrophy. Weight percentile declining faster than height — reflecting
increasing feeding difficulties and reduced caloric intake secondary to
motor and swallowing difficulties. No provider documented the overall
growth trend across visits; each visit noted "growth parameters within
normal limits" or "small for age."

NOTE: By age 12, all growth parameters are at or below the 3rd percentile.
Height gain has nearly ceased by age 13-14 — likely reflecting both the
neurodegenerative process and the effect of anticonvulsant medications on
growth. Weight DECLINE from age 13 to 14 (27.80 → 26.50 kg) is concerning
and reflects worsening dysphagia, increased caloric expenditure from
seizure activity, and progressive neurological decline. G-tube placement
was recommended at age 13.5 and placed at age 14 years 1 month.

Head circumference has plateaued at approximately 50.4 cm since age 10,
representing progressive microcephaly relative to normative growth. At
age 14, HC is at the 5th percentile — a decline from 50th at birth. This
trajectory is characteristic of NCL-related brain atrophy and distinguishes
the condition from primary (congenital) microcephaly.

                  SECTION 5D — MEDICATION HISTORY
================================================================================

Comprehensive chronological medication record compiled from all pharmacy
records, provider notes, and parent report.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANTICONVULSANT MEDICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. LEVETIRACETAM (Keppra) — First-line AED
   Start Date:     May 2021 (Age 9 years 2 months)
   Prescriber:     Dr. Angela Osei, MD — Pediatric Neurology, NCH Columbus
   Indication:     New-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures; EEG with
                   multifocal epileptiform discharges and diffuse background
                   slowing

   Dose History:
     May 2021:     250 mg PO BID (initial dose, weight 23 kg = 21.7 mg/kg/day)
     Jun 2021:     Titrated to 500 mg PO BID (43.5 mg/kg/day) — breakthrough
                   seizure at 2 weeks on initial dose
     Mar 2022:     Increased to 750 mg PO BID (Age 10, weight ~24.5 kg,
                   61.2 mg/kg/day) — seizure frequency increasing to
                   2-3 per week. Prescriber: Dr. Raymond Jeffers, MD,
                   Neurology, WAMC. NOTE: This increase occurred after
                   relocation to NC; Dr. Jeffers was working up patient
                   largely de novo without prior neurology records.
     Mar 2024:     Increased to 1000 mg PO BID (Age 12, weight ~27.5 kg,
                   72.7 mg/kg/day) — refractory seizures despite dual therapy

   Adverse Effects: Increased irritability and behavioral changes noted by
   mother at 750 mg dose (age 10). Behavioral side effects difficult to
   distinguish from disease progression. No dose-limiting toxicity.

   Current Status: ACTIVE — 1000 mg PO BID

2. CLOBAZAM (Onfi) — Adjunctive AED
   Start Date:     November 2022 (Age 10 years 8 months)
   Prescriber:     Dr. Raymond Jeffers, MD — Neurology, WAMC
   Indication:     Adjunctive therapy for refractory seizures (generalized
                   tonic-clonic and myoclonic) despite levetiracetam
                   monotherapy

   Dose History:
     Nov 2022:     5 mg PO BID (initial dose)
     Jan 2023:     Maintained at 5 mg PO BID — partial improvement in
                   seizure frequency (estimated 40% reduction per parent
                   seizure diary)
     Mar 2024:     Increased to 10 mg PO BID (Age 12) — seizure frequency
                   increasing again, myoclonic jerks becoming more
                   prominent and interfering with feeding

   Adverse Effects: Mild sedation at initiation, improved after 2 weeks.
   No paradoxical reactions. Drooling may be partially medication-related
   vs. disease-related oromotor dysfunction.

   Current Status: ACTIVE — 10 mg PO BID

3. VALPROIC ACID (Depakote / Divalproex Sodium ER)
   Start Date:     September 2024 (Age 12 years 6 months)
   Prescriber:     Dr. Samuel Park, MD — Neurology, EDI Consulting
   Indication:     Third-line AED added specifically targeting myoclonic
                   seizures, which had become the most disabling seizure
                   type (interfering with swallowing, communication, and
                   comfort)

   Dose History:
     Sep 2024:     250 mg PO BID (initial dose)
     Nov 2024:     Titrated to 375 mg PO BID — moderate improvement in
                   myoclonus frequency
     Feb 2025:     Increased to 500 mg PO BID (current, weight ~27 kg,
                   37 mg/kg/day) — valproic acid level 72 mcg/mL
                   (therapeutic range 50-100)

   Adverse Effects: Transient GI upset at initiation. Weight stabilization
   noted (valproic acid may partially offset disease-related weight loss).
   AST/ALT mildly elevated at age 12 — monitored q3 months. Platelets
   stable. Ammonia level 42 (within normal limits).

   Monitoring: Valproic acid trough level, CBC with differential, CMP
   including LFTs, ammonia — every 3 months.

   Current Status: ACTIVE — 500 mg PO BID

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREVIOUSLY TRIALED MEDICATIONS (NON-AED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. RISPERIDONE (Risperdal) — Atypical Antipsychotic
   Start Date:     October 2017 (Age 5 years 7 months)
   Stop Date:      August 2018 (Age 6 years 5 months)
   Prescriber:     Dr. Linda Huang, MD — Developmental Pediatrics, Columbus
   Indication:     "Behavioral dysregulation in the setting of ASD" —
                   specifically targeting episodes of screaming, agitation,
                   and apparent aggression

   Dose History:
     Oct 2017:     0.25 mg PO QHS (starting dose)
     Dec 2017:     0.5 mg PO QHS
     Feb 2018:     0.5 mg PO BID

   RETROSPECTIVE NOTE: The "behavioral episodes" that prompted risperidone
   use are now understood to have been post-ictal agitation and irritability
   following subclinical seizures. The behaviors were not volitional or
   consistent with ASD-related behavioral dysregulation. The medication
   was masking a neurological symptom rather than treating a psychiatric
   condition.

   Discontinuation Reason: Excessive sedation, weight gain (1.5 kg in
   4 months), and mother reported child seemed "more out of it" on
   medication. Tapered and discontinued August 2018.

5. MELATONIN — Over-the-Counter Supplement
   Start Date:     March 2016 (Age 4 years 0 months)
   Prescriber:     Dr. Karen Whitfield, MD — Developmental Pediatrics, VA
                   (recommended); continued by all subsequent providers
   Indication:     Sleep onset insomnia and irregular sleep-wake cycle,
                   attributed to ASD

   Dose History:
     Mar 2016:     1 mg PO QHS
     Sep 2018:     Increased to 3 mg PO QHS (per CCC pediatrician)
     Jun 2021:     Increased to 5 mg PO QHS (per Dr. Osei) — sleep
                   disruption worsening, likely related to increasing
                   seizure activity and neurological deterioration

   Current Status: ACTIVE — 5 mg PO QHS
   NOTE: Ongoing sleep disruption likely multifactorial: NCL-related
   circadian disruption, seizure-related arousals, medication effects.

CURRENT SUPPLEMENTS AND SUPPORTIVE MEDICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. N-ACETYLCYSTEINE (NAC)
   Start Date:     April 2025 (Age 13 years 1 month)
   Prescriber:     Dr. Samuel Park, MD — Neurology, EDI Consulting
   Indication:     Antioxidant supplementation based on emerging research
                   suggesting potential neuroprotective benefit in NCL
                   (Ref: Levin et al., 2014, Annals of Neurology;
                   ongoing clinical trials in NCL subtypes)
   Dose:           600 mg PO TID
   Adverse Effects: Mild GI upset initially, resolved. No other adverse
                   effects.
   Current Status: ACTIVE — 600 mg PO TID
   NOTE: Parents counseled that evidence for NAC in CLN5 is limited and
   this is considered experimental/supportive care only.

7. GLYCOPYRROLATE (Robinul)
   Start Date:     January 2026 (Age 13 years 10 months)
   Prescriber:     Dr. Park
   Indication:     Sialorrhea (excessive drooling) secondary to oromotor
                   dysfunction
   Dose:           1 mg PO TID
   Current Status: ACTIVE

8. POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL (MiraLAX)
   Start Date:     October 2024 (Age 12 years 7 months)
   Indication:     Chronic constipation secondary to immobility and
                   anticonvulsant medications
   Dose:           17 g PO daily, dissolved in 8 oz fluid via G-tube
   Current Status: ACTIVE

         SECTION 5E — INTER-PROVIDER COMMUNICATION FAILURE LOG
================================================================================

This section documents specific, verified instances where medical records
were lost, not transferred, not requested, or not reviewed during the
course of Eli Reeves' care. Information compiled through retrospective
records audit conducted by EDI Records Integration Unit, November 2025-
January 2026.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAILURE #1: Virginia → Ohio Transfer (Age 4, August 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date of Family Relocation: August 2016 (Fort Lee, VA → Columbus, OH)
New PCP: Columbus Children's Clinic — Dr. Margaret Sullivan, MD

RECORDS REQUESTED BY NEW PROVIDER:
  - "Most recent records from prior pediatrician"

RECORDS ACTUALLY RECEIVED:
  - Dr. Karen Whitfield, MD (Developmental Pediatrics, Richmond) —
    ASD diagnostic summary letter dated February 2016 (2 pages)
  - Dr. Sarah Tan, MD (Southeastern Pediatrics, Richmond) —
    Most recent well-child visit note (June 2016, 1 page)
  - Immunization records

RECORDS NOT TRANSFERRED / NOT REQUESTED:
  - Early developmental screening scores (ASQ-3 results from ages 9, 12,
    18, 24 months showing progressive score decline)
  - PT evaluation and treatment notes (4 months of physical therapy
    records documenting motor concerns, April-July 2016)
  - Speech therapy evaluation and progress notes
  - Well-child visit notes from ages 0-3 that documented parental
    concerns about staring spells and "zoning out"
  - MRI report from Richmond VAMC (September 2015, age 3.5) — this
    critical imaging study was in the VA system and was never requested
    by civilian providers
  - MRI images (on CD at VAMC Richmond — never transferred)
  - Audiology evaluation results (age 3, normal hearing — relevant to
    differential diagnosis of communication delays)

IMPACT: The receiving providers in Ohio had NO knowledge of:
  (a) The staring spells documented at age 2-3
  (b) The MRI that had been performed
  (c) The specific motor concerns that prompted PT referral
  (d) The trajectory of developmental screening scores showing decline
This created a "clean slate" effect where the Ohio providers inherited
only the ASD diagnosis without the concerning details that had accumulated
in Virginia.

ROOT CAUSE: Records release was initiated by parent (Denise Reeves) who
signed a general authorization at the pediatrician's office. The
pediatrician's office sent their own notes and the specialist letter
on file but did not send therapy records, VA system records, or
screening scores, as these were stored in separate systems or were
not considered part of the "medical record" by the releasing staff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAILURE #2: Neurology Records Request (Age 6-7, 2018-2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provider: Dr. David Chen, MD — Pediatric Neurology, Nationwide Children's
Hospital, Columbus, OH

Date of Initial Consultation: April 2018

RECORDS REQUESTED:
  - "Records from prior pediatrician regarding developmental history
    and any previous evaluations"

RECORDS RECEIVED:
  - Dr. Linda Huang, MD (Developmental Pediatrics, Columbus) — evaluation
    from November 2017 (full report)
  - Dr. Margaret Sullivan, MD (Columbus Children's Clinic) — office notes
    from 2016-2018

RECORDS NOT RECEIVED:
  - Any records from Virginia providers
  - Dr. Karen Whitfield's full developmental evaluation (only the summary
    letter was in Dr. Sullivan's chart — the full report remained in
    Virginia)
  - MRI from Richmond VAMC (age 3.5) — Dr. Chen ordered a NEW MRI
    (May 2018) without knowledge that a prior study existed. This is the
    single most consequential records failure in this case. Had the age-3
    MRI been available for comparison, the progressive cerebellar atrophy
    visible on the age-6 MRI would very likely have been identified.
  - Physical therapy and speech therapy records from Virginia
  - Audiology evaluation from Virginia

IMPACT: Dr. Chen interpreted the May 2018 MRI as an isolated study. The
"mildly prominent ventricles" were called a "likely normal variant."
With a comparison study from 2.5 years prior showing normal or near-normal
ventricles and cerebellum, the progressive change would have been apparent.
The MRI was read in isolation and the opportunity to identify
neurodegeneration at age 6 was missed.

ROOT CAUSE: Multi-system records fragmentation. Virginia records were in
civilian pediatric offices AND the VA medical system. Ohio providers
requested records from the Ohio pediatrician, who forwarded what they
had received from Virginia — which was already incomplete (see Failure #1).
No one requested records directly from Virginia or from the VA system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAILURE #3: Ohio → North Carolina Transfer (Age 10, June 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date of Family Relocation: June 2022 (Columbus, OH → Fayetteville, NC /
Fort Liberty)

New PCP: Sandhills Pediatrics — Dr. James Morton, MD
New Neurology: Womack Army Medical Center — Dr. Raymond Jeffers, MD

RECORDS REQUESTED BY NEW PROVIDERS:
  - Sandhills Pediatrics requested: "Complete medical records" from
    Columbus Children's Clinic
  - WAMC Neurology requested: "Neurology records" from Nationwide
    Children's Hospital

RECORDS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY SANDHILLS PEDIATRICS:
  - Columbus Children's Clinic notes (2016-2022): Received
  - Dr. Huang developmental evaluation: Received
  - Immunization records: Received
  - Growth chart data: Received
  - Medication list: Received (but outdated — did not include Keppra
    which had been prescribed by neurology, not pediatrics)

RECORDS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY WAMC NEUROLOGY:
  - Dr. David Chen's neurology notes (2018-2019): Received
  - MRI report from May 2018: Received
  - PARTIAL EEG report from NCH (January 2019): Received — but only
    the summary page, not the full technical report

CRITICAL RECORDS NOT TRANSFERRED TO EITHER PROVIDER:
  - Dr. Angela Osei's neurology notes (2021-2022) — INCLUDING her
    identification of the neurodegenerative pattern and her recommendation
    for genetic testing. REASON: Dr. Osei was a different neurologist at
    NCH from Dr. Chen. Records were released from "Neurology" but only
    Dr. Chen's older notes were in the general neurology folder. Dr. Osei's
    notes were filed under her subspecialty clinic (Neurogenetics) and
    were not captured by the standard records release process.
  - EEG results from June 2021 (Dr. Osei ordered) — showed multifocal
    epileptiform discharges and severe diffuse background slowing
  - MRI results from April 2021 (Age 9) — the study showing significant
    progressive cerebellar atrophy. This was filed under Radiology at NCH
    and was not included in the neurology records release.
  - Laboratory results from 2021 including the elevated lactate (2.8)
    and elevated L:P ratio (33)
  - Dr. Osei's genetics referral recommendation
  - Ophthalmology referral and results (retinal changes noted)
  - Physical therapy letter from Megan Calloway, PT, DPT describing
    cerebellar signs inconsistent with ASD

IMPACT: Dr. Jeffers at WAMC received records that effectively showed
the case as of 2019 — before the neurodegenerative process had been
identified. He had Dr. Chen's notes (which described ASD with seizures)
and the 2018 MRI (called "normal variant"). He did NOT have Dr. Osei's
critical notes that had already identified progressive neurodegeneration,
nor her MRI showing dramatic progression, nor her genetics recommendation.
Dr. Jeffers essentially started a new diagnostic workup from a point that
was already 3 years behind where Dr. Osei had left off.

This single records failure resulted in an estimated 2-year delay in
diagnosis. Dr. Jeffers spent from June 2022 to approximately March 2024
repeating evaluations and imaging that had already been completed in Ohio.

ROOT CAUSE: (1) Provider transition within the same institution (Chen →
Osei) created a records filing issue — Osei's subspecialty clinic notes
were not in the general neurology records. (2) Standard records release
processes do not typically capture all ancillary records (radiology, lab,
therapy notes) unless specifically requested. (3) The releasing institution
(NCH) processed a standard records release, not a comprehensive records
compilation. (4) No one at the receiving end recognized the records were
incomplete because they did not know what they were missing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAILURE #4: Military / Civilian Records System Fragmentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout Eli Reeves' care, records existed in multiple non-interoperable
systems:

MILITARY SYSTEMS:
  - TRICARE claims database: Contains claims data (dates of service, CPT
    codes, diagnoses billed) but NO clinical notes, test results, or
    imaging
  - MHS GENESIS (Military Health System EHR): Contains records from
    military treatment facilities (MTFs) only — in this case, Womack Army
    Medical Center records from 2022 onward. Does NOT contain civilian
    provider records even when paid by TRICARE.
  - Richmond VAMC system: MRI from age 3.5 was in the VA EHR (VistA/CPRS).
    This system is entirely separate from both TRICARE and MHS GENESIS.

CIVILIAN SYSTEMS:
  - Southeastern Pediatrics, Richmond: Paper charts, later scanned to
    local EMR (eClinicalWorks). No interoperability with any other system.
  - Columbus Children's Clinic: Athenahealth EMR. No connection to NCH
    system.
  - Nationwide Children's Hospital: Epic EHR. Records accessible within
    Ohio Epic network but not outside it.
  - Sandhills Pediatrics, NC: Practice Fusion EMR. No interoperability.
  - GeneDx (genetic testing lab): Results sent to ordering provider only.

IMPACT: At no point in Eli's 12-year diagnostic odyssey did any single
provider have access to his complete medical record. Each provider worked
from a partial picture. The military family's frequent relocations
compounded this issue — each move triggered a records transfer process
that was inherently lossy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAILURE #5: Insurance Records Fragmentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance History:
  - Birth to Age 4:  TRICARE Prime (East Region) — Humana Military
  - Age 4 to Age 10: TRICARE Select (West Region, then East Region) —
                     Health Net Federal Services, then Humana Military
  - Age 10 to present: TRICARE Prime (East Region) — Humana Military

Each TRICARE region change and plan change resulted in a new claims
history. Prior authorization records did not transfer between regions.
Referral histories were reset with each PCS (Permanent Change of Station)
move.

SPECIFIC IMPACT: When Dr. Jeffers at WAMC attempted to review what
testing had been done previously through the TRICARE claims system, only
claims from the current TRICARE enrollment period (2022-forward) were
readily accessible. Historical claims required a formal request to the
Defense Health Agency, which took 8 weeks to process and returned only
CPT code data without clinical context.

    SECTION 5F — CRITICAL TIMELINE OF MISSED DIAGNOSTIC OPPORTUNITIES
================================================================================

This forensic-style analysis was compiled as part of the EDI diagnostic
review. Each entry identifies a specific time point where the correct
diagnosis of CLN5 Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis could have been
reached or significantly advanced, the clinical event that represented
the opportunity, the action that was taken, the action that should have
been taken, and the estimated diagnostic delay attributable to each
missed opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSED OPPORTUNITY #1
Age 2-3 (2014-2015) — Virginia
Clinical Setting: Southeastern Pediatrics, Richmond, VA
Provider: Dr. Sarah Tan, MD (Pediatrician)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLINICAL EVENT: Mother reported "staring spells" and episodes of
unresponsiveness lasting 5-15 seconds at well-child visits at ages 24
months and 30 months. The child would stop what he was doing, stare
blankly, and be unresponsive to his name. Episodes occurred several
times daily.

ACTION TAKEN: Documented as "possible ASD-related inattention" and
contributed to the referral for developmental evaluation. No EEG ordered.
No specific seizure evaluation performed.

ACTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN: EEG. Any episode of unresponsiveness
in a toddler, regardless of ASD suspicion, warrants EEG to rule out
seizures. The AAP and the American Academy of Neurology recommend EEG
evaluation for children with paroxysmal staring events, particularly
when they involve loss of awareness.

PROBABLE OUTCOME IF CORRECT ACTION TAKEN: EEG at age 2-3 would likely
have shown either (a) subclinical epileptiform activity, which would
have prompted neurology referral and seizure-focused workup, or (b)
diffuse background slowing inconsistent with ASD alone. Either finding
would have raised concern for a condition beyond autism and potentially
triggered metabolic or genetic investigation 10 years before the eventual
diagnosis.

ESTIMATED DIAGNOSTIC DELAY ATTRIBUTABLE: Up to 10 years.

NOTE: It must be acknowledged that even if EEG had been obtained at this
age, the path to CLN5 diagnosis was not guaranteed. NCL was rare, genetic
testing was less accessible in 2014-2015, and the EEG findings may have
been nonspecific. However, the EEG would have at minimum reframed the
clinical picture away from pure ASD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSED OPPORTUNITY #2
Age 3.5 (September 2015) — Virginia
Clinical Setting: Dr. Karen Whitfield's Office, Developmental Pediatrics
Provider: Dr. Karen Whitfield, MD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLINICAL EVENT: During ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule)
testing, the psychometrist documented two separate episodes where Eli
became "briefly unresponsive" for approximately 10-12 seconds each,
followed by mild confusion. These were noted in the testing record as
"disengagement episodes consistent with ASD presentation."

ACTION TAKEN: The episodes were interpreted as ASD-related disengagement
or sensory overload. They were mentioned in the body of the ADOS-2
report but not flagged as clinically concerning. The ASD diagnosis was
confirmed. MRI was ordered (performed at VAMC Richmond) but EEG was not.

ACTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN: These episodes should have been
recognized as possible absence seizures. Brief unresponsiveness with
post-episode confusion is a classic presentation of absence or complex
partial seizures. EEG should have been ordered. The two episodes during
a single testing session suggest high seizure frequency.

PROBABLE OUTCOME: EEG would likely have confirmed seizure activity.
Combined with the MRI (even though the MRI was read as normal), the
presence of seizures in a child with developmental regression would
have shifted the differential from ASD to a seizure-related developmental
disorder. This would have prompted more aggressive investigation.

ESTIMATED DIAGNOSTIC DELAY ATTRIBUTABLE: 8-9 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSED OPPORTUNITY #3
Age 5 (2017) — Ohio
Clinical Setting: Columbus Children's Clinic / ABA Therapy Center
Provider: Dr. Margaret Sullivan, MD (Pediatrician)
Source: ABA therapist progress notes (Behavioral Dimensions, Inc.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLINICAL EVENT: ABA therapist Sarah Kim, BCBA, submitted a detailed
progress report noting: (1) Clear loss of previously mastered skills over
a 6-month period, including self-feeding, two-word phrases, and toileting
skills; (2) Multiple observed episodes that "appear seizure-like —
child freezes, eyes deviate to one side, unresponsive for 10-20 seconds,
followed by fatigue and crying"; (3) Recommendation for medical evaluation
stating "these presentations are not typical of ASD behavioral patterns
in my clinical experience."

ACTION TAKEN: Dr. Sullivan documented the ABA therapist's concerns and
placed a neurology referral. However, the referral was placed as
"routine" (not urgent) and the wait time for pediatric neurology at
Nationwide Children's Hospital was approximately 4 months. No interim
EEG was ordered. No interim seizure precautions were discussed.

ACTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN: The ABA therapist's observations
constituted a clear description of seizure activity with developmental
regression. This warranted: (1) Urgent (not routine) neurology referral,
(2) Stat or urgent outpatient EEG, (3) Consideration of empiric seizure
precautions, (4) Documentation of regression as a medical concern
distinct from ASD.

PROBABLE OUTCOME: EEG at age 5 would have confirmed seizures. Combined
with documented regression, this would have triggered a neurodegenerative
workup. Genetic testing (exome sequencing, available clinically by 2017)
could have yielded a CLN5 diagnosis by age 5-6 — approximately 7 years
before actual diagnosis.

ESTIMATED DIAGNOSTIC DELAY ATTRIBUTABLE: 4-7 years (depending on how
quickly genetic testing would have been pursued after seizure confirmation).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSED OPPORTUNITY #4
Age 6 (May 2018) — Ohio
Clinical Setting: Nationwide Children's Hospital, Neurology
Provider: Dr. David Chen, MD — Pediatric Neurology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLINICAL EVENT: Dr. Chen evaluated Eli for "ASD with possible seizures."
He ordered a brain MRI but did NOT order an EEG at this visit. His note
states: "Will obtain MRI brain to evaluate for structural etiology. If
MRI is unrevealing, will consider EEG at follow-up."

The MRI showed "mildly prominent ventricles, likely normal variant."
Dr. Chen's follow-up note states: "MRI essentially normal. Given ASD
diagnosis and no witnessed clinical seizures in office, will continue
to monitor. EEG can be obtained if clinical events increase."

ACTION TAKEN: MRI ordered (without prior comparison), read as essentially
normal. EEG deferred. Follow-up in 6 months.

ACTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN: (1) EEG should have been ordered
concurrently with MRI — it is standard practice to obtain both in the
evaluation of possible seizures. Deferring EEG pending MRI results is
not consistent with clinical guidelines. (2) Prior imaging from age 3.5
should have been obtained for comparison — but this would have required
knowledge that a prior MRI existed (see Communication Failure #2).

PROBABLE OUTCOME: (a) If EEG had been ordered: Very likely to show
epileptiform abnormalities, confirming seizure disorder and reframing
the clinical picture. (b) If prior MRI had been available: Side-by-side
comparison would have shown progressive cerebellar atrophy (as confirmed
by Dr. Choi's retrospective review), triggering immediate concern for
neurodegeneration. Either finding would have significantly advanced the
diagnostic process.

ESTIMATED DIAGNOSTIC DELAY ATTRIBUTABLE: 3-6 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSED OPPORTUNITY #5
Age 8 (2020) — Ohio
Clinical Setting: Private Physical Therapy Practice, Columbus, OH
Provider: Megan Calloway, PT, DPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLINICAL EVENT: Physical therapist Megan Calloway wrote a detailed letter
to Dr. Sullivan (pediatrician) dated March 12, 2020, which stated in
relevant part:

"I have significant concerns about Eli's motor presentation that I do
not believe are consistent with autism spectrum disorder alone. He
demonstrates progressive truncal and appendicular ataxia with
dysmetria, intention tremor, and wide-based gait that are CEREBELLAR
in nature. His motor skills have declined measurably over the 18 months
I have treated him. Children with ASD may have motor coordination
difficulties, but they do not typically show progressive cerebellar
signs with this trajectory. I strongly recommend re-evaluation by
pediatric neurology with specific attention to the cerebellum."

ACTION TAKEN: Dr. Sullivan received the letter and documented it in the
chart. A note was made: "Will discuss neurology re-referral at next
well-child visit." The next well-child visit was not until September
2020 — a 6-month delay. Neurology referral was placed in September 2020
as routine, with a 3-month wait. The appointment with Dr. Osei occurred
in January 2021.

ACTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN: This letter described progressive
cerebellar signs in a child with developmental regression — a clinical
emergency from a diagnostic standpoint. The appropriate response would
have been: (1) Immediate (urgent) neurology re-referral, (2) Direct
provider-to-provider communication with neurology to expedite, (3)
Consideration of urgent MRI given specifically described cerebellar
concerns.

PROBABLE OUTCOME: If neurology re-referral had been expedited in
March 2020 rather than September 2020, the diagnosis process that
Dr. Osei initiated in January 2021 would have started approximately
9-10 months earlier. Given that the family moved in June 2022, this
earlier start might have allowed completion of genetic testing before
the move — potentially yielding a diagnosis by age 9-10 rather than
age 12.

ESTIMATED DIAGNOSTIC DELAY ATTRIBUTABLE: 1-2 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSED OPPORTUNITY #6
Age 9 (2021) — Ohio
Clinical Setting: Nationwide Children's Hospital, Neurogenetics Clinic
Provider: Dr. Angela Osei, MD — Pediatric Neurology / Neurogenetics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLINICAL EVENT: Dr. Osei correctly identified the neurodegenerative
process through clinical examination, EEG, and MRI (April 2021). She
recommended genetic testing (whole exome sequencing) and ophthalmology
evaluation. She placed a ROUTINE referral to the Genetics department
at NCH for WES. Wait time for genetics at NCH: approximately 4-5 months.

The family received PCS orders in March 2022 (orders to Fort Liberty, NC)
and moved in June 2022. The genetics appointment was scheduled for
July 2022. The family notified NCH of the move and the appointment was
cancelled.

ACTION TAKEN: Genetics referral placed as routine. Appointment scheduled
for 4-5 months out. Family moved before appointment.

ACTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN: (1) Genetics referral should have
been placed as URGENT given the clear identification of a progressive
neurodegenerative condition in a child. (2) Given the military family
status, Dr. Osei or her team could have flagged the case for expedited
processing. (3) Alternatively, WES could have been ordered directly by
neurology without waiting for a separate genetics consultation — many
institutions allow neurologists to order WES with appropriate
justification. (4) A warm handoff with detailed clinical summary should
have been prepared for the receiving providers in North Carolina.

PROBABLE OUTCOME: If WES had been ordered directly by Dr. Osei in
spring 2021, results would have been available within 12-16 weeks
(typical turnaround). Diagnosis of CLN5 could have been made by
approximately August-September 2021 — at age 9, approximately 3 years
before actual diagnosis.

ESTIMATED DIAGNOSTIC DELAY ATTRIBUTABLE: 2-3 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSED OPPORTUNITY #7
Ages 10-12 (2022-2024) — North Carolina
Clinical Setting: Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Liberty, NC
Provider: Dr. Raymond Jeffers, MD — Neurology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLINICAL EVENT: Dr. Jeffers assumed care of Eli after the family's
relocation to NC. Due to the records transfer failure (see Communication
Failure #3), Dr. Jeffers did NOT have Dr. Osei's notes, the 2021 MRI,
the 2021 EEG, the elevated lactate results, or the genetics
recommendation. He received only Dr. Chen's older notes (2018-2019)
and the 2018 MRI.

Dr. Jeffers conducted his own evaluation and over the next 2 years:
  - Repeated the EEG (November 2022) — confirmed epilepsy
  - Ordered a new MRI (March 2024) — showed severe atrophy
  - Ordered metabolic labs (duplicating work from Ohio)
  - Eventually ordered enzyme studies (PPT1, TPP1) and genetic testing

ACTION TAKEN: Thorough but duplicative workup over a 2-year period.

ACTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN: (1) A more aggressive effort to
obtain complete records from NCH, including direct provider-to-provider
contact. (2) If records were unobtainable, a higher index of suspicion
given the clinical presentation — the severity of Eli's neurological
status at age 10 warranted urgent genetic evaluation rather than a
step-wise re-workup. (3) WES should have been considered earlier in the
evaluation rather than after 2 years of other testing.

NOTE: Dr. Jeffers' clinical care was appropriate given the information
he had available. The primary failure was in the records system, not in
his clinical judgment. However, the overall system failure resulted in
2 years of diagnostic delay.

ESTIMATED DIAGNOSTIC DELAY ATTRIBUTABLE: 2 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY: CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earliest Possible Diagnosis:      Age 2-3 (2014-2015) — if EEG had been
                                  obtained and triggered genetic workup
Most Realistic Earlier Diagnosis: Age 5-6 (2017-2018) — if seizures had
                                  been confirmed and WES ordered
Actual Diagnosis:                 Age 12 (June 2024) — WES result returned

Minimum Estimated Delay:          3 years (if Opportunity #6 alone had
                                  been captured)
Maximum Estimated Delay:          10 years (if Opportunity #1 had been
                                  captured)
Most Realistic Estimate:          5-7 years of potentially avoidable
                                  diagnostic delay

While it is not possible to state with certainty that any single
intervention would have led directly to the CLN5 diagnosis, the
cumulative weight of seven independent missed opportunities over 10 years
represents a systemic failure in the diagnostic process.


================================================================================
            SECTION 5G — SPECIAL EDUCATION TRAJECTORY
================================================================================

Compiled from Individualized Education Program (IEP) documents, school
psychological evaluations, related services reports, and parent-provided
copies of educational records across three school districts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE 4 — INITIAL IEP (2016-2017 School Year)
School District: Columbus City Schools, Columbus, OH
School: Cassingham Elementary School — Early Childhood Special Education
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION: August 2016
  Primary Disability Category: Autism
  Basis: Outside evaluation by Dr. Karen Whitfield, MD (Developmental
  Pediatrics, Richmond, VA) — diagnosis of ASD Level 2, dated February
  2016. School psychologist evaluation confirmed eligibility.

EVALUATION DATA:
  Cognitive:      Differential Ability Scales-II (DAS-II)
                  General Conceptual Ability (GCA): 72 (3rd percentile)
                  Verbal: 68 | Nonverbal: 78 | Spatial: 74
  Adaptive:       Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-3
                  Adaptive Behavior Composite: 70 (2nd percentile)
                  Communication: 65 | Daily Living: 72 | Socialization: 68
  Speech/Lang:    Preschool Language Scales-5 (PLS-5)
                  Auditory Comprehension: 71 | Expressive Communication: 64

PLACEMENT: Special education preschool — autism-specific classroom.
  12:1:2 staffing ratio (12 students, 1 teacher, 2 aides)
  1:1 aide assigned for safety and behavioral support

IEP GOALS (selected):
  - Communication: Will use 2-3 word phrases to request during structured
    activities in 4/5 opportunities
  - Social: Will engage in parallel play with a peer for 5 minutes with
    1 verbal prompt
  - Adaptive: Will follow a 2-step classroom routine with visual schedule
    support
  - Motor: Will navigate classroom environment independently including
    stairs with railing

RELATED SERVICES:
  - Speech/Language Therapy: 3x/week, 30 min individual
  - Occupational Therapy: 2x/week, 30 min individual
  - 1:1 Aide: Full school day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE 5 — IEP ANNUAL REVIEW (2017-2018 School Year)
School: Cassingham Elementary — Kindergarten, Self-Contained Autism Unit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROGRESS REVIEW: Minimal progress across all goal areas.
  - Communication: Inconsistently using 2-word phrases. Some days able,
    some days nonverbal. "Significant variability in performance."
  - Social: Limited engagement. Frequent "disengagement episodes" noted
    by classroom staff.
  - Adaptive: Requires full physical prompting for most routines.
  - Motor: Gait increasingly unsteady. Falls 2-3 times daily.

IEP AMENDMENTS:
  - Added OT goals for fine motor (handwriting readiness, self-feeding
    with utensils) — noted declining fine motor skills
  - Added sensory regulation goals (interpreted as ASD-related sensory
    processing difficulties)
  - Behavioral Intervention Plan (BIP) added for "episodes of
    screaming and agitation" — these are now understood to have been
    post-ictal behaviors

RELATED SERVICES (updated):
  - Speech/Language: 3x/week, 30 min
  - Occupational Therapy: 3x/week, 30 min (increased from 2x)
  - Adapted PE: 2x/week
  - 1:1 Aide: Full school day

TEACHER NARRATIVE (excerpt): "Eli has not made the progress we expected
this year. He seems to be losing skills he had at the beginning of the
year. Some days he can do things that he cannot do on other days. The
team is concerned about regression."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE 6 — IEP TRIENNIAL RE-EVALUATION (2018-2019 School Year)
School: Cassingham Elementary — 1st Grade, Self-Contained Autism Unit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ELIGIBILITY RE-EVALUATION: October 2018

EVALUATION DATA:
  Cognitive:      DAS-II (re-administration)
                  General Conceptual Ability (GCA): 58 (0.3rd percentile)
                  Verbal: 52 | Nonverbal: 62 | Spatial: 60

                  *** GCA DECLINE FROM 72 → 58 IN 2 YEARS ***
                  School psychologist notation: "Significant decline in
                  cognitive scores. This degree of decline is unusual and
                  warrants medical follow-up. Results shared with parent
                  and pediatrician."

  Adaptive:       Vineland-3
                  Adaptive Behavior Composite: 58 (0.3rd percentile)
                  Communication: 50 | Daily Living: 60 | Socialization: 55
                  *** Decline from 70 → 58 ***

  Speech/Lang:    Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-P2 (CELF-P2)
                  Core Language: 55 | Receptive: 58 | Expressive: 50

ELIGIBILITY: Continued — Autism. School psychologist recommended medical
evaluation for regression but did not change disability category.

IEP GOALS (revised, selected):
  - Communication: Will use single words or picture symbols to make
    choices during structured activities
  - Motor: Will walk independently in the hallway with supervision
    (reduced from stair navigation — no longer safe on stairs)
  - Adaptive: Will participate in hand-over-hand feeding routine
  - Cognitive: Will match identical objects with 80% accuracy

NOTE: The IQ decline from 72 to 58 over two years represents a clinically
significant regression. The school psychologist's recommendation for
medical follow-up was appropriate. However, this information was
communicated only to the pediatrician (Dr. Sullivan) via parent, not
directly to neurology. Dr. Chen in neurology did not receive the
psychoeducational evaluation data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE 7 — IEP ANNUAL REVIEW AND AMENDMENT (2019-2020 School Year)
School: Cassingham Elementary — 2nd Grade Placement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLACEMENT CHANGE: Moved from autism-specific classroom to Multiple
Disabilities (MD) classroom. Rationale: "Eli's needs now exceed what
can be provided in the autism classroom. He requires full physical
assistance for all transitions, is no longer ambulatory in the school
setting without support, and his communication has declined to gestural
only. The MD classroom provides nursing support, adaptive equipment,
and a lower student-to-staff ratio."

New Placement: 6:1:2 MD classroom with full-time 1:1 aide

IEP AMENDMENTS:
  - Added Physical Therapy goals: Maintain functional mobility with
    assistive device (posterior walker). Maintain seated posture in
    adapted chair.
  - Communication goal changed: Will use gesture (pointing, reaching)
    or eye gaze to indicate choice between 2 options
  - Assistive technology evaluation ordered

RELATED SERVICES (updated):
  - Speech/Language: 3x/week, 30 min (focus shifting to AAC)
  - Occupational Therapy: 3x/week, 30 min
  - Physical Therapy: 3x/week, 30 min (new)
  - Adapted PE: 2x/week
  - 1:1 Aide: Full school day
  - Nursing: As needed for seizure monitoring (no seizure diagnosis yet
    but school noted "episodes of concern")

ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY (AT) EVALUATION — December 2019:
  Conducted by: AT Specialist, Franklin County ESC
  Devices Trialed:
    - GoTalk 9+ (low-tech AAC device): Limited success — fine motor
      decline interfering with accurate button press
    - iPad with TouchChat app: Moderate success initially — able to
      select preferred items with whole-hand touch. Accuracy declined
      over subsequent months.
  Recommendation: Continue TouchChat with simplified layout. Consider
  eye-gaze technology if hand use continues to decline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE 8 — IEP ANNUAL REVIEW (2020-2021 School Year)
School: Cassingham Elementary — 3rd Grade (Hybrid/Remote during COVID-19)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: 2020-2021 school year significantly disrupted by COVID-19 pandemic.
Eli received homebound instruction from September 2020-February 2021
due to medical vulnerability. Returned to in-person with modifications
in March 2021.

PROGRESS REVIEW:
  - All goals: Regression noted across all domains during remote learning
    period. "Unable to meaningfully access remote instruction."
  - Motor: Now requires wheelchair for all school mobility. Can stand
    with maximal support for brief periods (transfers only).
  - Communication: Gestural communication only. Limited to reaching
    toward desired items. Vocalizations reduced to vowel sounds.
  - Feeding: Requires full adult assistance. Soft/puree diet. Frequent
    coughing during meals — swallowing concerns documented.

IEP AMENDMENTS:
  - All academic goals replaced with functional participation goals
  - Wheelchair and standing frame ordered through school
  - Seizure Action Plan added to IEP health plan (seizures now diagnosed
    by Dr. Osei, May 2021): Diastat protocol, nurse to be present at
    all times, emergency procedures documented

RELATED SERVICES:
  - Speech/Language: 3x/week, 30 min (AAC focus)
  - Occupational Therapy: 2x/week, 30 min (positioning, adaptive feeding)
  - Physical Therapy: 3x/week, 30 min (mobility, positioning, ROM)
  - Adapted PE: 1x/week (sensory-based)
  - 1:1 Aide: Full school day
  - Nursing: Full-time 1:1 RN (required for seizure management)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE 9 — IEP AMENDMENT (Spring 2021)
School: Cassingham Elementary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EMERGENCY IEP AMENDMENT — May 2021
Following Dr. Osei's diagnosis of epilepsy and identification of
neurodegenerative process:

  - Medical complexity formally documented in IEP
  - Seizure Action Plan updated with specific medication protocol:
    Diastat 10 mg rectal if seizure >5 minutes; call 911 if seizure
    >10 minutes or if breathing difficulty
  - Positioning protocol updated per PT (risk of aspiration)
  - Transportation changed to medical transport van with aide and
    wheelchair tie-down
  - Extended School Year (ESY) services approved for summer 2021 to
    prevent further regression during break

NOTE: This was the last IEP in the Columbus City Schools district. Family
relocated to North Carolina in June 2022.

TRANSFER IEP MEETING: August 2022
  Ohio IEP accepted as comparable services plan pending NC re-evaluation.

NC RE-EVALUATION: October 2022
  Primary Disability Category: Multiple Disabilities
  (Changed from Autism — NC team determined that the presentation was
  more accurately characterized under MD given the progressive nature)

EVALUATION DATA:
  Cognitive:      Unable to formally assess — "Eli is unable to
                  participate in standardized cognitive assessment due
                  to motor, communication, and visual limitations.
                  Functional cognitive level estimated at 12-18 month

AGE 12 — IEP ANNUAL REVIEW (2024-2025 School Year)
School: Seventy-First Classical Middle School
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IEP REVISION — October 2024
Following confirmed NCL/CLN5 diagnosis (June 2024):

  - Medical documentation updated with NCL diagnosis and prognosis
  - All remaining academic goals formally replaced with functional
    life skills and quality of life goals
  - Goals focus on: comfort, sensory engagement, communication
    maintenance (yes/no through eye gaze), social connection,
    and caregiver-directed positioning/health maintenance

IEP GOALS (selected):
  - Will demonstrate yes/no response through directed eye gaze (look
    up = yes, look down = no) with 60% consistency
  - Will demonstrate preference through sustained visual fixation
    on preferred stimuli
  - Will tolerate and participate in range-of-motion exercises
    performed by therapists without distress indicators
  - Will maintain alertness during preferred sensory activities
    (music, tactile stimulation) for 15 minutes

PROGRESS NOTE (March 2025): "Eli has limited but meaningful
communication through eye gaze. He consistently recognizes his mother
and responds to her voice with visual tracking and occasional smile.
He shows preference for music and tactile activities. Seizure frequency
has improved somewhat with current medication regimen. He requires total
care for all activities of daily living."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE 14 (CURRENT) — IEP AMENDMENT (2025-2026 School Year)
School District: Cumberland County Schools
Placement: HOMEBOUND INSTRUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IEP AMENDMENT — September 2025
Change of Placement: School-based → Homebound

RATIONALE: "Due to increasing medical fragility including frequent
seizures, aspiration risk, G-tube dependence, and overall decline in
medical stability, the IEP team, in consultation with the family and
medical providers, has determined that Eli can no longer safely attend
school in person. Homebound instruction will be provided per NC state
regulations."

HOMEBOUND SERVICES:
  - Certified special education teacher: 3 hours/week, in-home
  - Speech/Language therapist: 1x/week, 30 min, in-home (AAC
    maintenance, oral care, communication support)
  - Physical therapist: 1x/week, 30 min, in-home (ROM, positioning)
  - Occupational therapist: 1x/week, 30 min, in-home (sensory,
    positioning, adaptive)
  - Vision teacher: Monthly consultation

CURRENT IEP GOALS:
  - Communication: Will demonstrate yes/no response through eye gaze
    in response to simple questions with familiar communication partners
  - Engagement: Will show alertness and engagement during preferred
    sensory activities (music therapy, tactile books, family interaction)
    for minimum 10-minute intervals
  - Comfort: Will demonstrate reduced distress indicators (facial
    grimacing, body tension, crying) during positioning changes and
    care routines with the use of established comfort protocols
  - Connection: Will demonstrate social recognition of family members
    and familiar staff through visual tracking, smile, or vocalization

PARENT INPUT (Denise Reeves, IEP meeting September 2025):
"I want his goals to focus on his quality of life. I want him to be
comfortable, I want him to hear music, I want him to know that the people
who love him are there. That is what matters now. I want the school to
keep coming because it gives his day structure and he responds to the
teachers. He still lights up when Miss Angela [homebound teacher] comes.
That matters."

DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE STATEMENT: "Cumberland County Schools is
committed to providing Eli with meaningful educational services focused
on quality of life, communication maintenance, and social connection
for as long as his family desires these services. The district will
continue to provide homebound instruction, related services, and
adaptive equipment as outlined in this IEP."
