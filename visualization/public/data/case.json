She reports he is pulling\nto stand and has been doing so for approximately 2 weeks. He is not yet\ncruising along furniture. He crawled (on hands and knees) starting at\napproximately 10.5 months. He says 3-4 words: \"mama,\" \"dada,\" \"no,\" and\nsomething that sounds like \"ba\" for ball. He points to objects he wants\n(usually food or a toy) with his index finger. He claps his hands, plays\npat-a-cake. He is eating a variety of table foods. He drinks from a sippy cup.\nMother has recently weaned from breastfeeding. She plans to start whole milk.\n\nMother states: \"He seems a little behind the other kids in our playgroup \u2014\nthey're all walking by now. Is that normal?\" She mentions that a friend's baby\nthe same age is running already. Father is present at this visit and does not\nexpress concern: \"My brother didn't walk until 15 months and he's fine.\"\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs:\n  Weight: 21 lbs 0 oz (9.53 kg) \u2014 40th percentile\n  Length: 29.5 inches (74.9 cm) \u2014 38th percentile\n  Head Circumference: 46.0 cm \u2014 40th percentile\n  Temperature: 98.6 F (37.0 C)\n  Heart Rate: 118 bpm\n  Respiratory Rate: 26 breaths/min\n\nGeneral: Active, alert toddler.

Developmental milestones: Language, fine motor, social/emotional \u2014 all\n   age-appropriate. Gross motor mildly delayed \u2014 pulling to stand but not\n   cruising. Denver screen marginal in gross motor domain.\n3. Not walking is NOT abnormal at 12 months. Normal range for independent\n   walking is 9-18 months. However, the lack of cruising at 12 months bears\n   monitoring.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Immunizations: MMR #1, Varicella #1, HepA #1, PCV13 #4. Administered.\n2. Transition to whole milk. Limit to 16-24 oz/day.\n3. Discussed gross motor findings with parents. Reassured that gross motor\n   development is at the low end of normal and many children, particularly\n   boys, walk later. However, if not cruising by 15 months or walking by 18\n   months, will refer for evaluation.\n4. Encouraged active play, push toys, assisted standing activities.\n5.

Chart updated accordingly. \u2014 S. Mitchell, MD]\n\nVocabulary: Approximately 20 words. Mother has kept a written list: mama, dada,\nno, ball, bottle, dog, up, bye-bye, more, juice, car, shoe, eat, milk, book,\nbaby, hi, mine, hot, and cookie. NO two-word combinations. Mother states:\n\"He hasn't really learned new words in the last couple months. It's like he's\nstuck at 20.\" No pronoun use. No phrases. Does not put words together.\n\nNew concern \u2014 toe-walking: Mother reports that since Eli started walking, he\nfrequently walks on his toes. \"He walks normally some of the time, but a lot\nof the time he's up on his toes. I've asked the daycare and they see it too.\"\nEstimated toe-walking approximately 40-50% of the time per parent report.\n\nNew concern \u2014 hand movements: Mother describes: \"He does this thing with his\nhands \u2014 he wrings them together, like he's washing them. He does it a lot when\nhe's sitting and watching TV or when he's not playing with something. It's\ngotten more frequent.\" She estimates this occurs 5-8 times per day, lasting\n20-30 seconds each episode. She first noticed it around 20 months but it has\nbecome more prominent.\n\nStaring spells: Mother mentions for the first time: \"Sometimes he just zones\nout. He'll be sitting there and it's like he's not there for a few seconds.\nThen he snaps out of it and keeps going. It happens maybe a couple times a\nweek.\" Duration estimated at 5-10 seconds. No associated movements per mother's\nreport. No eye rolling, no lip smacking, no incontinence. She has not been\nable to interrupt the episodes by calling his name. \"It's like he can't hear\nme during those moments.\"\n\nEarly intervention services: PT started at 20 months, speech therapy started\nat 20 months.

Appointment requested urgently\n   given M-CHAT positive screen and multiple areas of concern. Family\n   advised wait time is approximately 4-6 months.\n2. Continue early intervention services (PT and speech therapy).\n3. Staring spells: Given brief duration, absence of motor phenomena, and\n   age of patient \u2014 monitoring at this time. Instructed mother to keep a\n   diary of episodes including frequency, duration, context, and any\n   associated symptoms. Will revisit at next visit and discuss with\n   developmental pediatrician.\n4. Toe-walking: Discussed with PT. Will incorporate targeted stretching and\n   gait training into PT sessions.\n5. Ordered: CBC, CMP, TSH/Free T4, lead level \u2014 screening labs for\n   developmental delay. Results to follow.\n6. Mother very anxious. Spent extended time counseling (total visit time\n   45 minutes). Discussed early intervention benefits. \"We are going to take\n   this one step at a time, and the developmental pediatrician will be our\n   best resource for a thorough assessment.\"\n7. Next well-child visit at 30 months or sooner if concerns escalate.\n\nLab results received March 22, 2014:\n  CBC: WNL (Hgb 12.1, Hct 36.2, WBC 8.4, Plt 285)\n  CMP: WNL (all values within normal reference ranges)\n  TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (normal: 0.5-4.5)\n  Free T4: 1.2 ng/dL (normal: 0.8-1.8)\n  Lead: <2 mcg/dL (normal)\n\n\u2014 Sarah E.

Developmental pediatrics\nappointment is scheduled for 2 weeks from now (October 1, 2014 \u2014 wait was\napproximately 6 months from referral).\n\nSpeech therapy progress: Mother reviewed most recent ST progress report with\nthis provider. Per report, Eli's vocabulary has expanded to approximately 25\nwords but spontaneous use in context remains limited. He is using some words\nin structured therapy sessions but not generalizing well to home environment.\nHe has attempted 1-2 two-word combinations in therapy (\"more juice,\" \"want\nball\") but these are inconsistent and require prompting. Receptive language\nshows some gains \u2014 he is following some one-step commands more consistently\nand beginning to identify body parts (nose, eyes) with about 50% accuracy.\n\nPhysical therapy progress: PT report states: \"Eli is walking independently\nwith a wide-based gait and intermittent bilateral toe-walking. Toe-walking\nappears to occur approximately 30-40% of the time, unchanged from last\nassessment. Balance reactions are delayed relative to age \u2014 he has difficulty\nrecovering from mild perturbations and falls 2-3 times during a 30-minute\nsession. He is not yet running consistently. He can climb stairs with hand-\nheld assistance. He cannot jump.\"\n\nMother reports staring spells are now occurring more frequently \u2014 \"maybe once\na day, sometimes more.\" Duration still 5-10 seconds. She has been keeping a\ndiary as instructed: over the past month, she documented approximately 25-30\nepisodes. Most last 5-8 seconds. They occur at various times \u2014 during play,\nduring meals, during TV time. During episodes, he stops all activity, stares\nstraight ahead, and does not respond to name or touch. After the episode, he\nresumes what he was doing without apparent confusion or distress. No motor\nphenomena observed by mother. No incontinence. No preceding aura behaviors\nthat mother can identify.\n\nHand-wringing: Persists. Mother estimates 8-10 episodes daily.\n\nMother states: \"I'm really worried. He's not getting better fast enough. The\nother kids at daycare are talking in sentences. He can barely say 20 words.\"\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs:\n  Weight: 27 lbs 0 oz (12.25 kg) \u2014 33rd percentile\n  Length: 34.5 inches (87.6 cm) \u2014 28th percentile\n  Head Circumference: 48.8 cm \u2014 33rd percentile\n  Temperature: 98.4 F (36.9 C)\n  Heart Rate: 102 bpm\n  Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/min\n\nGeneral: Alert toddler.

The evaluation was attended by Eli, his mother\n(Denise Reeves), and his father (Marcus Reeves) on April 1. Mother alone\nattended the April 3 session.\n\nREFERRAL CONCERNS:\nPer referral documentation and parent interview:\n1. Delayed gross motor milestones (walking achieved at approximately 26 months)\n2. Delayed expressive language (~25 words, no consistent phrases at 36 months)\n3. Delayed receptive language (inconsistent following of commands, limited\n   identification of objects/body parts)\n4. Repetitive hand-wringing/washing movements (>10 episodes/day)\n5. Intermittent staring episodes (1-2/day, 5-10 seconds duration)\n6. Intermittent toe-walking\n7. Wide-based, uncoordinated gait with frequent falls\n8. Positive M-CHAT-R/F at 24 months (6/20, 3 critical failures)\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:\n\nPrenatal/Birth History: Pregnancy uncomplicated. Spontaneous vaginal delivery\nat 39+2 weeks after elective induction. APGAR 8/9. Birth weight 7 lbs 6 oz.\nNo NICU stay. Passed newborn hearing screen and metabolic screen. No neonatal\ncomplications.\n\nDevelopmental Milestones (per parent report and medical records):\n  Social smile: 6 weeks\n  Rolled over: 3.5 months\n  Sat independently: 7 months\n  Babbled (canonical): 6 months\n  First words: 12 months (3-4 words)\n  Crawled: 10.5 months\n  Pulled to stand: 12 months\n  Cruised: 14.5 months\n  Walked independently: 26 months (DELAYED \u2014 expected by 18 months)\n  Vocabulary at 24 months: ~20 words (DELAYED \u2014 expected 50+ words)\n  Current vocabulary at 36 months: ~25 words, no phrases (SIGNIFICANTLY\n  DELAYED \u2014 expected 200+ words, 2-3 word sentences)\n\nParents report that early milestones (up to approximately 12 months) were\nachieved within expected timeframes, with subsequent deceleration of\ndevelopment most notable in gross motor and language domains.\n\nParents also report a perceived plateau or possible regression in vocabulary\nover the past 2-3 months \u2014 mother notes 2 previously used words (\"shoe,\"\n\"car\") have not been heard recently.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY:\nNo hospitalizations. No surgeries. No known allergies. No current medications.\nImmunizations up to date. Labs: CBC, CMP, TSH, lead \u2014 all normal (March 2014).\nHearing screen: Passed (6 months \u2014 OAE).\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nAs documented in PCP records. Notable: Paternal grandmother with progressive\nmemory difficulties onset in late 50s, no formal diagnosis. No family history\nof autism, epilepsy, or known neurodevelopmental disorders. Parents are non-\nconsanguineous.\n\nCURRENT SERVICES:\nPhysical therapy: 1x/week, 45-minute sessions, since age 20 months.\nSpeech-language therapy: 2x/week, 30-minute sessions, since age 20 months.\nNo ABA therapy (waitlisted). No special education placement currently.\nAttends home daycare 3 mornings/week.\n\nBEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:\n\nEli was observed over two sessions totaling 4.5 hours. He arrived for the first\nsession in his mother's arms and was reluctant to separate initially but did\ntransition to the testing room with both parents present.\n\nAppearance: Well-groomed, appropriately dressed boy. Appeared well-nourished.\nNo dysmorphic features noted.\n\nActivity Level and Behavior: Eli was intermittently cooperative with testing\ndemands. He demonstrated periods of engagement with test materials, interspersed\nwith periods of disinterest and self-directed activity. He frequently returned\nto hand-wringing behavior when not actively engaged with materials or when\nbetween test items. The hand-wringing was stereotypic in nature \u2014 rhythmic,\nbilateral, occurring at midline, involving a repetitive rubbing/wringing motion\nof the hands. This behavior was observed approximately 12-15 times across the\ntwo testing sessions and appeared to be a default resting behavior when hands\nwere not otherwise occupied. The behavior did not appear to be associated with\ndistress or emotional arousal; rather, it occurred in a variety of contexts and\nemotional states. This stereotypic behavior is consistent with the restricted/\nrepetitive behavior domain described in Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nGait and Motor Observations: Eli walked independently with a wide-based gait.\nToe-walking was observed intermittently (estimated 30-40% of steps). When\nwalking flat-footed, his gait appeared mildly uncoordinated with reduced arm\nswing. He tripped and fell once during the first session while walking across\nthe room. He had difficulty navigating a step up into the testing room (required\nhand-held assistance). His overall motor coordination appeared below age\nexpectations.\n\nLanguage and Communication: Eli used approximately 8-10 recognizable words\nduring the evaluation sessions combined. He used \"mama\" frequently, \"no\"\nseveral times, \"more\" during snack time, and \"ball\" when presented with a ball\nduring testing. Utterances were single words only \u2014 no multi-word combinations\nwere observed. Non-verbal communication was limited: he did not use pointing to\nshare interest (protodeclarative pointing absent), though he occasionally\nreached toward desired objects. He did bring a toy car to his mother once\n(possible showing behavior, though ambiguous \u2014 may have been requesting\nassistance rather than sharing). He did not follow a point across the room\nconsistently (successful on approximately 2/6 trials). He did not direct the\nexaminer's attention to objects or events.\n\nEye Contact and Social Engagement: Eye contact was present but inconsistent and\noften fleeting. Eli made eye contact most frequently with his mother and less\nso with the examiner. During structured one-on-one interactions (e.g., ball\nplay, book-sharing), he demonstrated more sustained eye contact and social\nengagement. During unstructured periods, he tended to engage in solitary\nactivity (manipulating a toy, hand-wringing) without seeking social interaction.\nHe did not demonstrate imaginative or pretend play \u2014 his play was largely\nfunctional (rolling a car, stacking blocks) or sensorimotor (mouthing objects,\nspinning wheels of a toy car).\n\nAttention and Engagement: Two notable episodes of apparent disengagement were\nobserved during testing:\n\n  Episode 1 (Session 1, approximately 45 minutes into evaluation): Eli was\n  seated at the table during Bayley-III cognitive items. He suddenly ceased\n  activity, eyes became fixed in a forward gaze, and he was unresponsive to\n  the examiner calling his name twice and to a light touch on his shoulder\n  from his mother. The episode lasted approximately 7-8 seconds. He then\n  blinked, looked down at the test materials, and resumed manipulating the\n  blocks without any apparent confusion, disorientation, or distress.\n\n  Episode 2 (Session 2, approximately 30 minutes into evaluation): During\n  ADOS-2 Module 1 administration, Eli was engaged in free play with a set\n  of toys. He stopped playing, stared fixedly at the wall, and was again\n  unresponsive to his name for approximately 5-6 seconds. He then resumed\n  playing, picking up the toy he had put down. Mother noted, \"That's one of\n  his staring spells \u2014 he does that all the time.\"\n\n  Clinical Impression Regarding Staring Episodes: These episodes presented\n  as brief periods of apparent inattention and disengagement lasting\n  approximately 5-8 seconds, during which the child was unresponsive to\n  auditory and tactile stimuli. Upon resolution, the child returned to his\n  prior activity without evidence of postictal confusion, distress, or\n  disorientation. While the possibility of absence seizures can be considered\n  in the differential, the clinical presentation is more consistent with\n  dissociative or inattentive episodes as commonly observed in children with\n  Autism Spectrum Disorder. The brief duration, lack of motor phenomena (no\n  eye blinking, lip smacking, automatisms, or tonic/clonic activity), lack\n  of postictal state, and the context of occurring in a child with an\n  emerging autism presentation make these episodes most consistent with ASD-\n  related disengagement. An EEG is not recommended at this time, though this\n  may be reconsidered if episodes change in character, increase significantly\n  in frequency or duration, or if motor phenomena develop.\n\nSTANDARDIZED TESTING RESULTS:\n\n1.

Lower\n    extremities: tone appears within normal limits, though examination is\n    somewhat limited by child's cooperation. [Note: Subtle hypotonia may\n    be present but is difficult to ascertain definitively in a\n    semicooperative 3-year-old. No frank hypotonia or hypertonia detected.]\n  Reflexes: Biceps 2+, triceps 2+, brachioradialis 2+, patellar 2+,\n    Achilles 2+ bilaterally. Symmetric. Plantar responses: flexor\n    bilaterally. No clonus.\n  Coordination: Reaches for objects accurately. Unable to cooperate with\n    formal finger-to-nose or heel-to-shin testing due to age and\n    developmental level. No obvious dysmetria on reaching.\n  Gait: Wide-based. Intermittent bilateral toe-walking (approximately 30%\n    of observed steps). Reduced arm swing. Occasional loss of balance with\n    direction changes. No definitive ataxia, but gait pattern is mildly\n    abnormal for age.\n  Involuntary movements: No tremor. No chorea. No dystonia.

Subtle early findings of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis\n(cerebellar volume changes, periventricular white matter signal changes) may\nnot be detectable at this age and/or may require specialized neuroradiology\ninterpretation.]\n\nDIAGNOSTIC FORMULATION AND IMPRESSIONS:\n\nBased on comprehensive evaluation including clinical interview, behavioral\nobservation, standardized assessment, physical/neurological examination, and\nneuroimaging, the following diagnostic impressions are offered:\n\n1. AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD), DSM-5 299.00 (F84.0)\n   Severity: Level 2 \u2014 Requiring Substantial Support\n\n   Specifiers:\n   - With accompanying intellectual impairment\n   - With accompanying language impairment\n\n   Justification: Eli meets DSM-5 criteria for ASD based on the following:\n\n   Criterion A \u2014 Persistent deficits in social communication and social\n   interaction across multiple contexts:\n   A1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity: Limited social overtures,\n       reduced sharing of interests and emotions, limited initiation of\n       social interaction.\n   A2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors: Poorly modulated eye\n       contact, limited use of gestures (pointing for sharing absent),\n       limited integration of verbal and nonverbal communication.\n   A3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships:\n       Limited engagement with peers, absence of imaginative/pretend play,\n       limited interest in social interaction beyond immediate needs.\n\n   Criterion B \u2014 Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or\n   activities:\n   B1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements: Hand-wringing stereotypy\n       is prominent and frequent.\n   B2. Insistence on sameness: Not prominently observed during evaluation,\n       though mother reports some preference for routine at home.\n   B3. Highly restricted, fixated interests: Spinning wheels of toy car\n       for extended periods. Limited play repertoire.\n   B4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input: Not prominently observed\n       during evaluation.\n\n   At least 2/4 B criteria met (B1, B3).\n\n   Criterion C: Symptoms present in early developmental period \u2014 confirmed.\n   Criterion D: Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment \u2014 confirmed.\n   Criterion E: Not better explained by intellectual disability alone \u2014 the\n   social communication deficits exceed what would be expected based on\n   cognitive level alone. ADOS-2 comparison score of 7 supports moderate\n   ASD symptom severity.\n\n   Level 2 justification: Eli requires substantial support. He demonstrates\n   marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication, social\n   impairments apparent even with supports in place, limited initiation of\n   social interactions, and reduced or abnormal response to social overtures.\n   Restricted/repetitive behaviors are frequent and obvious to the casual\n   observer (hand-wringing) and interfere with functioning in multiple\n   contexts.\n\n2. INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, MILD (F70)\n   Bayley-III Cognitive Composite: 72 (borderline range)\n   Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite: 67 (significantly below average)\n   Functioning level is consistent with mild intellectual disability given\n   scores approximating 2 standard deviations below the mean across both\n   cognitive and adaptive measures.\n\n3. MIXED RECEPTIVE-EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE DISORDER (F80.2)\n   Significant language delays in both receptive and expressive domains,\n   beyond what is accounted for by cognitive level and ASD.\n\n4. MOTOR DELAYS (R62.0) with intermittent toe-walking (R29.3)\n   Gross motor more affected than fine motor. Wide-based gait. Etiology\n   attributed to overall developmental profile in context of ASD with\n   associated motor impairment.\n\n5. STEREOTYPIC MOVEMENT DISORDER (noted as feature of ASD, Criterion B1)\n   Hand-wringing is classified within the ASD diagnosis rather than as a\n   separate stereotypic movement disorder, as it is best understood as a\n   restricted/repetitive behavior within the autism presentation.\n\n6. STARING SPELLS \u2014 ETIOLOGY UNCLEAR\n   As detailed in behavioral observations, two episodes of brief\n   disengagement (5-8 seconds) were observed. Clinical presentation is most\n   consistent with dissociative/inattentive episodes as commonly seen in\n   ASD. EEG not recommended at this time. Parents to continue monitoring\n   and report any change in character.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy: 25-30 hours per week recommended.\n   Eli's profile warrants intensive, evidence-based behavioral intervention\n   targeting social communication, play skills, functional language, and\n   reduction of interfering stereotypic behaviors. Recommend provider with\n   experience in Level 2 ASD with co-occurring intellectual disability.\n\n2. Speech-Language Therapy: Increase to 2 times per week (individual sessions,\n   30-45 minutes each). Focus on functional communication, vocabulary\n   expansion, requesting, and initiation of communication. Consider\n   augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) \u2014 picture exchange system\n   (PECS) or speech-generating device trial if verbal language does not\n   progress within 3-6 months.\n\n3. Occupational Therapy: Initiate OT 1 time per week to address fine motor\n   development, sensory processing, and self-help skills (feeding, dressing).\n\n4. Physical Therapy: Continue current PT services 1 time per week for gait\n   training, balance, coordination, and toe-walking management. Consider\n   serial casting or orthotics if toe-walking persists.\n\n5. Special Education: Eli is eligible for special education preschool services\n   under IDEA Part B (transitioning from Part C). Recommend placement in a\n   structured special education preschool program with low student-to-teacher\n   ratio, speech and language support embedded, and ASD-specific programming.\n   An IEP should be developed immediately.\n\n6. Neuroimaging: MRI brain completed \u2014 normal for age.\n\n7. Follow-Up: Return to this clinic in 6 months for reassessment of progress\n   and treatment response. May consider additional genetic or metabolic testing\n   if progress is not commensurate with intervention intensity.\n\n8. Family Support: Provided information on local ASD parent support groups\n   (Autism Society of Central Virginia). Discussed available TRICARE benefits\n   for ASD-related services (family has military insurance through father's\n   active duty status).\n\nThis evaluation was discussed in detail with both parents. They expressed\nunderstanding of the diagnosis and plan. Mother was tearful but stated she\n\"finally has an answer.\" Father asked about the cause \u2014 I explained that ASD\nis a neurodevelopmental condition with likely genetic underpinnings, that it\nis not caused by parenting or environmental factors, and that the cause in\nmost cases is not identifiable through a single test. I noted that genetic\ntesting (chromosomal microarray, Fragile X) could be considered but is\noptional at this stage and can be discussed at the follow-up visit.\n\nReport prepared by:\n\nJames R.

Currently\n  receiving 20 hours/week (unable to access full 25-30 recommended due to\n  provider availability). Mother reports \"mixed\" progress. ABA supervisor\n  reports Eli is \"cooperative but makes inconsistent gains.\" Targets include\n  requesting (manding), eye contact, imitation, and reducing hand-wringing.\n  Manding with PECS has been partially introduced \u2014 Eli can exchange 1 picture\n  card for a preferred item approximately 50% of trials. Verbal requesting\n  has not increased.\n- Speech therapy: 2x/week individual sessions. Therapist reports vocabulary\n  has expanded minimally to approximately 28-30 words but spontaneous use\n  remains limited. No consistent two-word combinations despite 6 months of\n  focused intervention. Therapist has recommended AAC device trial.\n- OT: 1x/week. Addressing fine motor and self-help skills. Some progress\n  with spoon use and hand-over-hand dressing tasks.\n- PT: 1x/week. Toe-walking persists. Gait remains wide-based.\n- Special education preschool: Enrolled in district-based ASD classroom since\n  August 2015 (beginning of school year). Teacher reports he is \"quiet,\n  compliant, but not engaging much with peers.\"\n\nMother concerns today:\n- \"The ABA isn't really working the way I thought it would. He's been doing it\n  for 4 months and I don't see big changes.\"\n- \"The hand-wringing hasn't gotten better at all \u2014 if anything, it's worse.\"\n- \"He's still having those staring spells. I think they might be more frequent\n  now \u2014 maybe 2-3 times a day.\" Mother reports spells are unchanged in\n  character: 5-10 seconds, staring, unresponsive, then resumes activity.\n- Mother asks directly: \"Could these be seizures? I looked it up online and\n  absence seizures look exactly like what Eli does.\"\n\nFather is present at this visit. He is quieter but nods in agreement with\nmother's concerns. He asks: \"Is there something else going on besides autism?\"\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs:\n  Weight: 31 lbs 4 oz (14.17 kg) \u2014 33rd percentile\n  Height: 38.5 inches (97.8 cm) \u2014 26th percentile\n  Head Circumference: 49.5 cm \u2014 28th percentile\n  Temperature: 98.4 F axillary\n\nGeneral: Alert boy. Walking with wide-based gait. Toe-walking observed. Hand-\nwringing observed 4 times during 30-minute visit. Eye contact fleeting.\n\nNeurological: Tone \u2014 mildly reduced in lower extremities (more apparent today\nthan at initial evaluation \u2014 may be progressive or may represent better\ncooperation with examination). Upper extremity tone normal. Reflexes 2+\nsymmetric. No clonus. Plantars flexor. Gait wide-based, intermittent toe-\nwalking. No ataxia per se but mild clumsiness with direction changes. Hand-\nwringing prominent.\n\nLanguage: Used \"mama\" and \"no.\" No other words observed during visit. Made\nnon-specific vocalizations.\n\nSocial: Brief eye contact with examiner. More engaged with mother. Did not\ninitiate interaction with examiner.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. ASD Level 2 with co-occurring mild intellectual disability \u2014 progress\n   with intensive intervention has been modest. This is not unexpected at\n   this stage. ABA benefit often takes 6-12 months to fully manifest.\n2. Hand-wringing stereotypy \u2014 unchanged/possibly increased. This is a common\n   and often persistent stereotypic behavior in ASD.\n3. Staring episodes \u2014 parents continue to report. Frequency may be increasing\n   (now 2-3/day per parent report). Mother specifically asks about absence\n   seizures. Discussion with parents:\n\n   \"I understand your concern about seizures. The staring episodes Eli\n   experiences are brief, non-convulsive, and he returns to baseline without\n   confusion or distress. While absence seizures are in the differential,\n   these episodes are consistent with dissociative or inattentive episodes\n   that are commonly seen in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n   Children with ASD frequently experience brief episodes of apparent\n   disengagement, particularly during periods of sensory overload or\n   during transitions between activities. There is no clinical indication\n   for epilepsy at this time, as the episodes are brief and non-convulsive\n   with no associated motor phenomena. I would not recommend an EEG at this\n   time. However, if the episodes change in character \u2014 for example, if\n   they become longer, if you see eye rolling, lip smacking, or body\n   stiffening, or if they increase significantly in frequency \u2014 please\n   contact our office and we can reconsider.\"\n\n4. Growth: Height percentile continues gradual decline (now 26th). Weight\n   more stable. Head circumference 28th \u2014 also declining from earlier\n   measurements. Pattern is notable and will continue to be monitored.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Continue ABA therapy \u2014 encourage increasing to full 25-30 hours/week if\n   provider availability allows. Request updated treatment plan from BCBA.\n   ABA program should incorporate specific protocols to address stereotypic\n   hand-wringing through differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors\n   (DRA) and response interruption/redirection (RIRD).\n2. Continue speech therapy 2x/week. Support AAC device trial as recommended\n   by SLP.\n3. Continue OT and PT.\n4. Continue special education preschool.\n5. Staring spells: Continue monitoring. Diary maintenance. No EEG at this\n   time.\n6. Genetic testing: Discussed with parents. Offered chromosomal microarray\n   and Fragile X testing. Parents defer at this time \u2014 \"We want to see how\n   he does with therapy first.\" Explained that genetic testing would not\n   change the current treatment plan but could provide etiologic information.\n   Parents to consider and may pursue at follow-up.\n7. Parents report they are expecting a military reassignment (PCS) to Fort\n   Wright, Ohio, likely in the next 3-6 months. Will prepare transfer of\n   care documentation when timing is confirmed.\n8. Follow-up: 6 months, or sooner if concerns escalate.\n\n\u2014 James R.

This letter summarizes his developmental history,\ndiagnostic evaluation, and current treatment plan.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY:\nEli was evaluated at our center in April 2015 (age 3 years, 0 months) and\nreceived the following diagnoses:\n\n1. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), DSM-5 299.00 (F84.0)\n   Severity Level: Level 2 \u2014 Requiring Substantial Support\n   With accompanying intellectual impairment\n   With accompanying language impairment\n\n2. Mild Intellectual Disability (F70)\n\n3. Mixed Receptive-Expressive Language Disorder (F80.2)\n\n4. Motor Delays with intermittent toe-walking\n\nEVALUATION FINDINGS (April 2015):\n- ADOS-2 Module 1: SA + RRB Total = 17 (exceeds Autism cutoff of 16).\n  Comparison Score: 7.\n- Bayley-III: Cognitive 72, Language 65, Motor 68.\n- Vineland-3: Communication 68, DLS 72, Socialization 62, Motor 70.\n  Adaptive Behavior Composite: 67.\n- MRI Brain (April 2015): Normal for age.\n- Basic metabolic panel, CBC, thyroid function, lead: All normal.\n- Hearing screen: Passed (OAE).\n- Genetic testing: Offered but deferred by parents.\n\nKEY CLINICAL FEATURES:\nEli meets DSM-5 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 2. His\npresentation is characterized by:\n- Significantly delayed expressive and receptive language (currently ~28-30\n  words, no consistent phrases at age 3 years 10 months)\n- Limited social communication (reduced eye contact, absent protodeclarative\n  pointing, limited joint attention)\n- Prominent hand-wringing stereotypy (repetitive, bilateral, rhythmic hand-\n  wringing/washing movements occurring >10 times daily; this is the most\n  prominent restricted/repetitive behavior in his presentation)\n- Intermittent staring episodes (5-10 seconds, 2-3 times daily per parent\n  report; clinically assessed as dissociative/inattentive episodes consistent\n  with ASD rather than epileptiform activity; EEG not performed)\n- Gross motor delays with wide-based gait and intermittent bilateral toe-\n  walking\n- Mild intellectual disability on formal testing\n\nThe hand-wringing stereotypies and intermittent disengagement episodes are\ncharacteristic of his autism presentation. I recommend continuation of\nintensive ABA therapy and speech-language services as the cornerstone of his\ntreatment program.\n\nCURRENT SERVICES:\n- ABA therapy: 20 hours/week (recommended 25-30 hours/week; increase if\n  possible). Provider: Behavioral Pathways, Inc., Richmond, VA.\n- Speech-Language Therapy: 2x/week individual sessions.\n- Occupational Therapy: 1x/week.\n- Physical Therapy: 1x/week.\n- Special Education: Enrolled in ASD-specific preschool classroom through\n  Richmond City Public Schools. Current IEP on file with school district.\n\nRECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:\n1. Establish care with a developmental-behavioral pediatrician or pediatric\n   neurologist in the receiving area for ongoing monitoring.\n2. Continue ABA at maximum recommended intensity.\n3. Continue speech therapy with consideration of AAC device trial if verbal\n   language does not progress.\n4. Continue OT and PT.\n5. Monitor staring episodes. If they change in character, increase in\n   frequency or duration, or if motor phenomena develop, EEG should be\n   considered at that time.\n6. Genetic testing (chromosomal microarray, Fragile X) may be considered\n   at the discretion of the receiving provider. Parents have thus far\n   deferred.\n7. Monitor growth trajectory \u2014 percentiles have been gradually declining\n   (height now ~26th percentile, head circumference ~28th). May warrant\n   nutritional assessment if trend continues.\n8. Next comprehensive developmental reassessment recommended at approximately\n   age 4.5-5 years, or sooner if significant clinical changes occur.\n\nI would be happy to discuss Eli's case by telephone if you have any questions.\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJames R.

Crawling onset at 10.5 months. Pulling to\nstand at 12 months. Cruising along furniture at approximately 14.5 months.\nCurrently cruising well but has not taken independent steps. Parents report he\nwill stand independently for 2-3 seconds before sitting down.\n\nNo history of regression in motor skills. No seizure history (parents report\nbrief \"zoning out\" episodes but these have not been formally evaluated). No\northopedic history. No known genetic or metabolic conditions.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n\nGross Motor Evaluation (Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2, Gross Motor\nsubtest):\n  Gross Motor Quotient: 73 (Mean = 100, SD = 15)\n  Age Equivalent: 13 months (chronological age: 20 months)\n  Classification: Below Average\n\nSpecific findings:\n- Stationary: Sits independently with good balance. Transitions between\n  sitting and prone/supine smoothly. Pulls to stand on furniture. Stands\n  holding on with one hand.\n- Locomotion: Crawls reciprocally on hands and knees \u2014 well-coordinated.\n  Cruises along furniture with lateral stepping pattern. Walks with two\n  hands held. Walks with one hand held \u2014 emerging, inconsistent (takes 4-5\n  steps then loses balance). NOT walking independently. NOT climbing stairs.\n- Object Manipulation: Throws ball forward (underhand) \u2014 emerging. Kicks ball\n  \u2014 not yet.\n\nGait Observation (with hand-held assistance):\n  - Wide base of support (inter-malleolar distance approximately 6 inches \u2014\n    wider than expected for age)\n  - Bilateral toe-walking observed on approximately 40% of steps during\n    hand-held walking\n  - Reduced arm swing\n  - Trunk rotation diminished\n  - Balance reactions (lateral protective) \u2014 delayed; compensatory stepping\n    reactions inconsistent\n\nTone Assessment:\n  - Upper extremities: Normal tone throughout range of motion.\n  - Lower extremities: Mild hypotonia noted on passive assessment \u2014\n    particularly at the hip girdle. Decreased resistance to passive movement\n    at hips and knees compared to age expectations.\n  - Trunk: Mild axial hypotonia \u2014 reduced trunk stability during dynamic\n    activities (e.g., reaching in standing).\n\nRange of Motion:\n  - Bilateral ankles: Full dorsiflexion to 15 degrees past neutral with knee\n    extended and flexed. No Achilles contracture. Toe-walking appears habitual/\n    behavioral rather than secondary to musculoskeletal restriction.\n\nStrength:\n  - Formal manual muscle testing not performed due to age. Functional\n    strength assessment: hip abductors and extensors appear mildly weak\n    based on Trendelenburg-type pattern observed during assisted walking.\n    Quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexors appear functional.\n\nBalance:\n  - Static standing balance (with support): Good.\n  - Dynamic balance: Poor. Loses balance with minimal perturbation in\n    standing. Protective reactions (forward, lateral, backward) inconsistent\n    and delayed.\n\nCLINICAL IMPRESSION:\nEli presents with significant gross motor delay, with a gross motor age\nequivalent of approximately 13 months at a chronological age of 20 months\n(7-month delay). His motor profile is characterized by: (1) delayed\nacquisition of independent walking; (2) wide-based gait pattern with\nintermittent bilateral toe-walking; (3) delayed balance reactions; and\n(4) mild generalized hypotonia, most prominent in axial and lower extremity\nmusculature. The hypotonia may be contributing to the wide-based gait pattern\nas a compensatory mechanism for reduced postural stability.\n\nGOALS (6-MONTH):\n1. Eli will walk independently across a 15-foot room without hand-held\n   assistance in 3 out of 5 trials.\n2. Eli will demonstrate flat-footed walking >70% of the time during a\n   10-minute observation period.\n3. Eli will recover balance from mild lateral perturbation in standing\n   without falling in 4 out of 5 trials.\n4. Eli will climb 3 stairs with one hand on railing and minimal assist.\n\nPLAN:\nDirect PT services 1x/week, 45-minute sessions.\nTreatment will include:\n- Weight-bearing and balance activities in standing\n- Gait training with progressive reduction of support\n- Heel cord stretching and sensory input to feet to discourage toe-walking\n- Hip and core strengthening through functional play activities\n- Balance reaction training\n- Parent education on home exercise program\n\n\u2014 Karen Lindstrom, PT, DPT, PCS\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY INITIAL EVALUATION\nDate of Service: October 17, 2013\nPatient Age: 20 months 2 days\nEvaluating Therapist: Angela Torres, MS, CCC-SLP\nICD-10: F80.2 (Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder)\nCPT: 92523 (SLP evaluation, comprehensive)\n\nIDENTIFYING INFORMATION:\nEli Reeves is a 20-month-old male referred for speech-language evaluation\nthrough Virginia Infant & Toddler Connection due to concerns about delayed\nlanguage development. Referral from Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Greenfield Pediatrics.\n\nHISTORY:\nPer parent report and medical records: First words appeared at approximately\n12 months (\"mama,\" \"dada,\" \"no\"). Vocabulary slowly expanded to approximately\n12 words by 18 months. Mother reports vocabulary growth has slowed in recent\nmonths. No two-word combinations. Uses some gestures (reaching, inconsistent\nwaving). Does not consistently point to share interest. Sometimes does not\nrespond to name. Hearing screen passed at 6 months (OAE).\n\nASSESSMENT:\n\nPreschool Language Scales, Fifth Edition (PLS-5):\n  Auditory Comprehension Standard Score: 74 (Mean = 100, SD = 15)\n    Age Equivalent: 14 months\n    Percentile Rank: 4th\n  Expressive Communication Standard Score: 68 (Mean = 100, SD = 15)\n    Age Equivalent: 12 months\n    Percentile Rank: 2nd\n  Total Language Standard Score: 70 (Mean = 100, SD = 15)\n    Percentile Rank: 2nd\n    Classification: Significantly Below Average\n\nMacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) \u2014 Words and Gestures\n(completed by mother):\n  Words Understood: 85 (below 10th percentile for 20 months)\n  Words Produced: 14 (below 5th percentile for 20 months)\n  Total Gestures: 28/63 (below 10th percentile for 20 months)\n\nOral-Motor Examination:\n  Oral structures: Within normal limits. Lips, tongue, palate, dentition \u2014\n  all normal. Tongue mobility adequate. No drooling. Oral-motor coordination\n  for feeding \u2014 adequate per parent report (eating table foods, using sippy\n  cup). Velopharyngeal function appears adequate. No oral-motor apraxia\n  suspected at this time, though assessment is limited by age and cooperation.\n\nSpeech Sound Inventory:\n  Consonant sounds produced during evaluation: /m/, /b/, /d/, /n/. Limited\n  consonant repertoire. Vowel production appears adequate. Syllable shapes:\n  primarily CV (e.g., \"ma,\" \"ba,\" \"no\") and CVCV reduplicative (e.g., \"mama,\"\n  \"dada\"). No consonant clusters. No final consonants observed.\n\nPragmatic/Social Communication Observations:\n  - Eye contact: Present but inconsistent.\n  - Requesting: Reaches toward desired objects. Occasional use of \"more\" in\n    context. Does not yet point to request consistently.\n  - Protodeclarative pointing (pointing to share interest): ABSENT.\n  - Joint attention (following point): Inconsistent \u2014 follows point\n    approximately 40% of attempts.\n  - Showing/giving objects: Not observed.\n  - Response to name: Inconsistent (3/6 trials).\n  - Turn-taking in vocal play: Emerging \u2014 occasional vocal back-and-forth\n    but brief.\n\nCLINICAL IMPRESSION:\nEli presents with a mixed receptive-expressive language delay, with both\ncomprehension and production significantly below age expectations. Expressive\nlanguage is more severely affected than receptive. His vocabulary of\napproximately 12-14 words at 20 months is significantly below the expected\n50th percentile of approximately 50 words. Social communication skills are\nalso delayed, with absent protodeclarative pointing and inconsistent joint\nattention. These social communication deficits raise concern for a possible\nautism spectrum condition, which should be evaluated by a developmental\nspecialist.\n\nGOALS (6-MONTH):\n1. Eli will expand expressive vocabulary to at least 30 words used\n   spontaneously across settings.\n2. Eli will use pointing (index finger) to request desired items in 4 out\n   of 5 opportunities.\n3. Eli will respond to his name by orienting toward the speaker in 4 out\n   of 5 trials.\n4. Eli will follow one-step commands without gestural cues in 3 out of 5\n   trials.\n5. Eli will initiate a communicative act (verbal or gestural) to gain\n   adult attention at least 5 times per 30-minute session.\n\nPLAN:\nDirect speech-language therapy services 2x/week, 30-minute sessions.\nTreatment will include:\n- Vocabulary expansion through naturalistic and structured activities\n- Prompting and reinforcing communicative intent (pointing, gestures, words)\n- Joint attention and social communication activities\n- Receptive language activities (following commands, identifying objects)\n- Parent coaching for language-rich home environment\n\n\u2014 Angela Torres, MS, CCC-SLP\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRESS SUMMARY\nReporting Period: October 2013 \u2014 April 2014 (Ages 20-25 months)\nTherapist: Karen Lindstrom, PT, DPT, PCS\nICD-10: R62.0\nCPT: 97110, 97530, 97116 (weekly sessions)\n\nPATIENT: Eli Reeves | DOB: 03/15/2012 | MRN: VITC-R-2013-5582\n\nATTENDANCE: 22 of 24 scheduled sessions attended (2 cancellations \u2014 illness).\n\nPROGRESS TOWARD GOALS:\n\nGoal 1: Independent walking across 15-foot room \u2014 PARTIALLY MET.\n  Eli began taking independent steps at approximately 22-23 months (December\n  2013). By 25 months, he is walking independently across a room but with\n  significant qualitative concerns. He can walk 15+ feet independently but\n  requires 1-2 rest stops (pauses, stands still, then resumes). He falls\n  approximately 2-3 times per 30-minute session, typically when turning or\n  navigating around obstacles.\n\nGoal 2: Flat-footed walking >70% of time \u2014 NOT MET.\n  Toe-walking persists at approximately 30-40% of observed steps. There has\n  been no significant change in toe-walking frequency despite targeted\n  interventions including heel cord stretching, sensory-based foot\n  activities (walking on varied textures), and ankle-foot orthosis trial\n  (family declined consistent use after 2-week trial \u2014 Eli protested wearing\n  the braces and mother found them difficult to manage with shoes).\n\nGoal 3: Balance recovery from lateral perturbation \u2014 PARTIALLY MET.\n  Eli can recover from very mild perturbation but continues to fall with\n  moderate perturbation. Balance reactions remain delayed relative to age.\n  Lateral protective extension is present but slow and inconsistent.\n\nGoal 4: Stair climbing \u2014 NOT MET.\n  Eli will ascend 2 stairs with two hands held but is not yet using a\n  railing independently for stair climbing.\n\nCURRENT FUNCTIONAL STATUS:\nEli is walking independently as of approximately 25-26 months of age. His\ngait pattern, however, remains qualitatively abnormal:\n  - Wide base of support (inter-malleolar distance ~5 inches)\n  - Intermittent bilateral toe-walking (~30-40% of steps)\n  - Reduced arm swing\n  - Mildly unsteady with frequent stumbles and falls\n  - Difficulty with direction changes and obstacle navigation\n  - Cannot run\n  - Cannot jump\n  - Stair climbing requires significant assistance\n\nTone continues to be mildly reduced in lower extremities and trunk. No\nchange in tone assessment from initial evaluation.\n\nTHERAPIST'S IMPRESSION:\nEli has made progress in the primary goal of achieving independent ambulation,\nwhich is a significant functional milestone. However, the quality of his gait\nremains concerning. The persistent wide-based pattern, ongoing toe-walking,\nand balance deficits suggest underlying neuromotor dysfunction beyond simple\nmotor delay. The mild hypotonia, delayed balance reactions, and gait\nabnormalities could be consistent with a central nervous system etiology\nrather than isolated developmental motor delay. I have shared these\nobservations with the referring physician.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Continue PT 1x/week, 45-minute sessions.\n2. Updated goals to focus on gait quality, stair climbing, running, jumping,\n   and balance.\n3. Re-evaluate need for ankle-foot orthoses if toe-walking persists beyond\n   age 3.\n4. Recommend discussion with developmental pediatrician regarding etiology\n   of motor findings.\n\n\u2014 Karen Lindstrom, PT, DPT, PCS\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSPEECH-LANGUAGE THERAPY PROGRESS SUMMARY\nReporting Period: October 2013 \u2014 April 2014 (Ages 20-25 months)\nTherapist: Angela Torres, MS, CCC-SLP\nICD-10: F80.2\nCPT: 92507 (treatment sessions, 2x/week)\n\nPATIENT: Eli Reeves | DOB: 03/15/2012 | MRN: VITC-R-2013-5582\n\nATTENDANCE: 44 of 48 scheduled sessions attended (4 cancellations).\n\nPROGRESS TOWARD GOALS:\n\nGoal 1: Expand expressive vocabulary to 30 words \u2014 PARTIALLY MET.\n  Eli's vocabulary has expanded from approximately 14 words at initial\n  evaluation to approximately 22-25 words per parent report and clinical\n  observation. New words added include: eat, milk, book, baby, hi, hot,\n  cookie, and \"uh-oh.\" However, the rate of acquisition has slowed over the\n  past 2 months. He acquired approximately 6-8 words in the first 3 months\n  of therapy but only 2-3 in the most recent 3-month period. Spontaneous\n  use of words remains limited \u2014 he uses approximately 8-10 words\n  consistently and the remainder are used only with prompting or in specific\n  contexts. He does not use words to comment or share \u2014 word use is primarily\n  for requesting.\n\nGoal 2: Pointing to request \u2014 PARTIALLY MET.\n  Eli is now using an index finger point to request desired items in\n  approximately 2 out of 5 opportunities (40%). He still frequently uses\n  reaching or whole-hand gestures rather than a specific point. Proto-\n  declarative pointing (pointing to share interest or show something) remains\n  ABSENT.\n\nGoal 3: Respond to name \u2014 PARTIALLY MET.\n  Response to name has improved to approximately 3 out of 5 trials (60%),\n  up from approximately 50% at intake. However, this remains inconsistent\n  and below age expectations.\n\nGoal 4: Follow one-step commands \u2014 PARTIALLY MET.\n  Eli follows simple one-step commands (e.g., \"give me the cup,\" \"sit down\")\n  in approximately 3 out of 5 trials during structured activities. He\n  requires repetition and gestural cues in most instances. He is beginning\n  to identify some body parts (points to nose and eyes with ~50% accuracy).\n\nGoal 5: Initiate communicative acts \u2014 MINIMALLY MET.\n  Eli initiates communicative acts approximately 2-3 times per 30-minute\n  session, primarily through reaching, occasional pointing, and infrequent\n  word use. He does not yet initiate communication to share attention,\n  comment, or engage socially \u2014 initiation is limited to basic requesting.\n\nTHERAPIST'S IMPRESSION:\nEli has made inconsistent progress in speech-language therapy over the past\n6 months. While his vocabulary has expanded modestly, the rate of acquisition\nhas decelerated rather than accelerated, which is atypical. In typically\ndeveloping children, vocabulary growth accelerates rapidly between 18-24\nmonths (the \"word explosion\"), and Eli has not demonstrated this pattern. His\nspontaneous use of language remains significantly limited, and his social\ncommunication profile \u2014 including absent protodeclarative pointing, limited\njoint attention, and restricted communicative functions (requesting only, no\ncommenting or sharing) \u2014 continues to raise concern for autism spectrum\ndisorder. The limited and decelerating progress despite consistent, evidence-\nbased intervention is concerning and suggests that his language delay may be\npart of a broader neurodevelopmental condition rather than an isolated speech-\nlanguage disorder.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Continue speech-language therapy 2x/week.\n2. Updated goals with emphasis on functional communication across settings.\n3. Begin introducing PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) as an\n   augmentative communication strategy given limited verbal progress.\n4. Strongly recommend comprehensive developmental evaluation to clarify\n   diagnostic picture and guide intervention.\n5. Consider AAC device trial if verbal language does not show meaningful\n   gains in the next 3-6 months.\n\n\u2014 Angela Torres, MS, CCC-SLP\n\n\n================================================================================\n  END OF SECTION 1 \u2014 RECORDS COVERING BIRTH THROUGH AGE 4\n  NEXT SECTION: Section 2 \u2014 Ages 4-8, Ohio Providers\n================================================================================\n\n                         DOCUMENT METADATA\n  Compiled by:       Emergent Diagnostic Institution\n  Date Compiled:     February 2026\n  Total Providers:   3 (PCP, Developmental Pediatrician, Early Intervention)\n  Total Records:     19 clinical documents\n  Date Range:        March 17, 2012 \u2014 February 10, 2016\n  Page Equivalent:   ~38 pages\n\n================================================================================\n================================================================================\n                        MEDICAL RECORDS \u2014 SECTION 2\n                     PATIENT: ELI REEVES (DOB: 03/15/2012)\n                          AGES 4 YEARS \u2013 7 YEARS\n                     COVERING DATES: 05/2016 \u2013 03/2019\n                        COLUMBUS, OHIO PROVIDERS\n================================================================================\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \u2014 SECTION 2\n\n  PROVIDER 3:  Buckeye Behavioral Health \u2014 ABA Therapy Center\n               Columbus, OH (6 records)\n\n  PROVIDER 4:  Dr. Patricia Huang, MD \u2014 Columbus Children's Medical Group\n               Columbus, OH (8 records)\n\n  PROVIDER 5:  Dr. Robert Chen, MD \u2014 Ohio Neurology Associates\n               Columbus, OH (3 records)\n\n  SCHOOL RECORDS: Maple Grove Elementary School\n                  Columbus, OH (3 records)\n\n================================================================================\n                              PROVIDER 3\n             BUCKEYE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH \u2014 ABA THERAPY CENTER\n                    1847 Scioto Crossing Boulevard\n                       Columbus, OH 43215\n                  Phone: (614) 555-0192 Fax: (614) 555-0193\n                     NPI: 1922384756 Tax ID: 31-4829173\n================================================================================\n\nCLIENT:        Eli Reeves\nDOB:           03/15/2012\nCLIENT ID:     BBH-2016-0847\nINSURANCE:     Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Ohio\nPOLICY #:      XGK882401557\nFUNDING AUTH:  Prior Authorization #ABA-OH-2016-28841\nAUTHORIZED:    25 hours/week ABA therapy, authorized through 11/30/2016\n               (renewable per 6-month review)\nBCBA:          Jennifer Mallory, M.Ed., BCBA (License #OH-BCBA-2014-1192)\nRBT:           Deshawn Carter, RBT (Certification #RBT-2015-40281)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECORD 3.1 \u2014 INTAKE BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDATE OF ASSESSMENT:  05/18/2016\nCLIENT AGE:          4 years, 2 months\nASSESSMENT TYPE:     Comprehensive Behavioral Intake Assessment\nASSESSMENT TOOL:     Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program\n                     (VB-MAPP), Sundberg 2008\nREFERRING PROVIDER:  Dr. Marcus Whitfield, MD \u2014 Blue Ridge Developmental\n                     Pediatrics, Roanoke, VA\nREFERRAL DIAGNOSIS:  Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2 \u2014 Requiring Substantial\n                     Support (ICD-10: F84.0)\nASSESSMENT SETTING:  Buckeye Behavioral Health clinic, therapy room 3\nASSESSMENT DURATION: 90 minutes (direct observation + structured probes)\nPARENT PRESENT:      Yes \u2014 mother (Denise Reeves)\n\nI. REASON FOR REFERRAL\n\nEli Reeves is a 4-year, 2-month-old biracial male referred for Applied Behavior\nAnalysis (ABA) therapy by Dr. Marcus Whitfield of Blue Ridge Developmental\nPediatrics, Roanoke, VA. Eli was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2,\nat age 3 years, 6 months following developmental pediatrics evaluation. The family\nrecently relocated to Columbus, OH due to parental employment. Mother reports\nthat Eli received approximately 4 months of ABA therapy in Virginia prior to the\nmove but services were interrupted. Transfer records from Blue Ridge ABA Services\n(Roanoke) were requested but had not been received at the time of this\nassessment.\n\nPer parent interview, primary concerns include: limited verbal communication\n(approximately 15-20 words used inconsistently), repetitive hand-wringing\nmovements, toe-walking, \"staring spells\" described as brief episodes of\nunresponsiveness, difficulty with peer interaction, and need for support in\nadaptive daily living skills.\n\nII. BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATION DURING ASSESSMENT\n\nEli was accompanied by his mother to the assessment. He did not acknowledge the\nassessor upon introduction and did not make eye contact during the initial\ngreeting. He walked independently into the therapy room with a mildly wide-based\ngait and intermittent toe-walking (estimated 40% of observed steps were on toes).\n\nThroughout the 90-minute assessment, the following behaviors were observed:\n\n  - Hand-wringing/hand-washing stereotypy: 14 discrete episodes observed\n    (averaging >10 per 30-minute interval), each lasting 3-8 seconds. Movements\n    were rhythmic, bilateral, and occurred at midline. They appeared involuntary\n    and did not appear to serve a communicative or self-stimulatory function in\n    the typical manner observed in our ASD population.\n\n  - Toe-walking: Present approximately 40% of ambulatory time. Bilateral.\n\n  - Disengagement episodes: 4 episodes observed during the 90-minute assessment.\n    Duration ranged from 5 to 15 seconds. During these episodes, Eli ceased all\n    motor activity, appeared to stare blankly ahead with a slight upward gaze\n    deviation, and was unresponsive to his name or tactile prompts. Following\n    each episode, he appeared briefly disoriented (looking around the room as if\n    reorienting) before resuming activity. No convulsive movements were observed.\n    Mother confirmed these episodes are consistent with what she observes at\n    home, stating: \"He does that all the time \u2014 we call it zoning out.\"\n\n  - Verbal output: During the assessment, Eli produced 6 recognizable words\n    (\"mama,\" \"no,\" \"juice,\" \"more,\" \"go,\" \"bye\") in appropriate but limited\n    contexts. No multi-word combinations were observed. Echolalia was minimal\n    (2 instances of immediate echolalia). No delayed echolalia observed.\n\n  - Social engagement: Eli did not initiate any social bids toward the assessor.\n    He responded to his name 3 of 10 trials (30%). He oriented briefly toward\n    the assessor when preferred items (bubbles, light-up toy) were presented but\n    did not sustain joint attention beyond 2-3 seconds.\n\n  - Fine motor: Eli demonstrated a crude palmar grasp on crayons. He was able\n    to stack 4 blocks (mother reports he could stack 6 blocks three months ago).\n    He successfully buttoned one large button on a dressing frame with moderate\n    physical effort and 2 attempts.\n\n  - Gross motor: Gait was wide-based with intermittent toe-walking as noted.\n    Eli navigated the room independently. He climbed onto a child-sized chair\n    without assistance. He fell once during a transition from sitting on the\n    floor to standing.\n\nIII.

CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS\n\nEli presents with significant skill deficits across all VB-MAPP domains,\nconsistent with his diagnosis of ASD Level 2. His overall milestone score of\n31.5/170 places him primarily within the Level 1 range (developmental equivalent\nof approximately 0-14 months across domains), which represents a substantial\ndelay for his chronological age of 4 years, 2 months.\n\nClient demonstrates limited manding (requesting), with most mands consisting of\nreaching toward desired items or leading an adult by the hand. Manding with\nwords was observed in only 2 instances during the assessment. Tacting (labeling)\nwas minimal, with Eli labeling only 3 items during structured probes (ball,\ncup, bubbles). No intraverbal skills (answering questions, fill-ins, or\nconversational exchanges) were observed.\n\nStereotypic behaviors include hand-wringing (>10 episodes per 30-minute\nobservation period), toe-walking, and brief apparent disengagement episodes\n(4 observed during 90-minute assessment, lasting 5-15 seconds each). The\nhand-wringing is notably persistent and appears qualitatively different from\ntypical hand-flapping stereotypy commonly observed in our ASD client population \u2014\nit is more rhythmic and washing-like in quality. The disengagement episodes are\nalso noteworthy; while inattention and \"tuning out\" are common in ASD, the\nabruptness of onset, apparent unresponsiveness to stimuli, and brief post-episode\nconfusion are somewhat atypical.\n\nAssessment is consistent with ASD Level 2 diagnosis per referral documentation\nfrom Dr. Whitfield. Eli is an appropriate candidate for intensive ABA therapy\ntargeting manding, tacting, listener responding, imitation, and adaptive skills.\n\nVI. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Intensive ABA therapy: 25 hours/week (5 hours/day, 5 days/week)\n2. Primary focus areas:\n   a. Mand training using naturalistic environment teaching (NET) and\n      discrete trial training (DTT)\n   b. Tact training with errorless learning procedures\n   c. Listener responding expansion\n   d. Motor imitation building\n   e. Reduction of stereotypic behaviors through differential reinforcement\n3. Data collection: Continuous frequency data on target behaviors, ABC data\n   on disengagement episodes\n4. Parent training: Monthly parent training sessions (2 hours/month)\n5. Coordination with speech-language pathology and occupational therapy\n6. Progress review: Monthly by BCBA, formal progress reports quarterly\n7.

NOTABLE CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nClient has made minimal progress across all domains during this reporting\nperiod. Of the 5 treatment goals, 2 show minimal progress, 2 show regression,\nand 1 shows no change. This rate of progress is below expectations for a client\nreceiving 25 hours/week of intensive ABA services.\n\nOf particular note:\n\n  1. Listener Responding Regression: Several previously mastered listener\n     responding tasks are now inconsistent. At intake, Eli could reliably\n     match 4 colors (red, blue, yellow, green) on a field of 3 with 90%\n     accuracy. He now matches only 2 colors (red, blue) with 75% accuracy.\n     Receptive identification of body parts has also declined from 5 (head,\n     eyes, nose, mouth, hands) to 3 (head, hands, mouth).\n\n  2. Motor Imitation Decline: Eli could imitate 6 gross motor actions at\n     intake. He now consistently imitates only 5, and accuracy has declined\n     from 70% to 65%. Fine motor imitation (stacking patterns, placing pegs)\n     has also declined.\n\n  3. Disengagement Episodes: Frequency has remained stable at approximately\n     4-6 per 3-hour session. Duration appears unchanged (5-15 seconds).\n     Post-episode confusion continues to be observed.\n\nBCBA hypothesizes that the regression in listener responding and visual\nperceptual matching may be due to motivational factors, environmental change\n(new home, new therapy setting, new therapists), or the transition period\nassociated with the family's interstate move. It is also possible that the\nstructured demands of intensive ABA are creating escape-motivated behavior\nthat presents as skill loss. RBT has been instructed to vary reinforcement\nschedules and conduct preference assessments more frequently.\n\nPlan:\n  - Modify reinforcement strategies; conduct weekly preference assessments\n  - Reduce demand level on regressed tasks, rebuild using errorless teaching\n  - Continue data collection on disengagement episodes\n  - Schedule parent conference to discuss progress concerns\n\n_____________________________________\nJennifer Mallory, M.Ed., BCBA\nDate: 08/22/2016\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECORD 3.3 \u2014 SIX-MONTH PROGRESS REPORT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDATE OF REPORT:     11/21/2016\nREPORTING PERIOD:   08/22/2016 \u2013 11/18/2016\nCLIENT AGE:         4 years, 8 months\nSERVICE HOURS:      Authorized: 25 hrs/week | Delivered: 23.1 hrs/week average\nTOTAL SESSIONS:     58 sessions this period (cumulative: 114 sessions)\nBCBA SUPERVISION:   Monthly (4 sessions direct, 8 hours total)\n\nI. SUMMARY OF PROGRESS\n\nThis report documents a continued pattern of skill regression that is\nincreasingly concerning. Despite modifications to reinforcement strategies,\nreduction in demand levels, and consultation with the clinical supervisor\n(Dr. Amy Okonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D), Eli has not made measurable progress\ntoward any treatment goal and has demonstrably lost previously acquired\nskills in multiple domains.\n\nII. GOAL PROGRESS\n\nGoal 1: Manding\n  Baseline (05/16): 2 vocal mands\n  3-month (08/16):  4 mands total (3 vocal, 1 sign)\n  Current (11/16):  3 mands total (2 vocal: \"mama,\" \"more\"; 1 sign: \"more\")\n  Status:           REGRESSION \u2014 lost 1 vocal mand (\"juice\") acquired in\n                    prior period\n\nGoal 2: Tacting\n  Baseline: 3 tacts | 3-month: 4 tacts | Current: 3 tacts\n  Status:   REGRESSION \u2014 lost tact \"car\"; retained ball, cup, bubbles\n\nGoal 3: Listener Responding\n  Baseline: 5 instructions/60% | 3-month: 4/55% | Current: 3/50%\n  Status:   CONTINUED REGRESSION\n\nGoal 4: Motor Imitation\n  Baseline: 6 actions/70% | 3-month: 5/65% | Current: 3/50%\n  Status:   SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION \u2014 see detailed note below\n\nGoal 5: Adaptive Skills\n  Current status: Hand washing now requires full physical prompting\n  throughout sequence. Buttoning: Eli can NO LONGER button independently \u2014\n  this skill was clearly present at intake and has been lost. Pincer grasp\n  is notably weaker; Eli has difficulty picking up small items (beads,\n  coins) that he previously manipulated without difficulty.\n  Status:   SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION\n\nIII.

Total VB-MAPP milestone score has decreased by\n9.0 points (28.6% decline) over 6 months of intensive therapy.\n\nIV. CRITICAL CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe following observations represent significant clinical concerns:\n\n  1. LOSS OF FINE MOTOR SKILLS: Tasks mastered during month 2 of therapy\n     (placing pegs in pegboard, stacking 5 blocks, turning pages of a book)\n     are no longer performed. Eli's fine motor capabilities have declined\n     measurably since intake. He now has difficulty with pincer grasp tasks\n     that were within his repertoire at the start of services. Buttoning,\n     which was independently performed at intake, now requires full physical\n     assistance.\n\n  2. GROSS MOTOR COORDINATION DECLINE: Gross motor coordination appears to\n     have declined substantially. Eli now falls frequently during transitions\n     between activities \u2014 an average of 3.2 falls per 3-hour session over\n     the past month (compared to 0.8 falls per session during month 1).\n     His gait has become more visibly unsteady, with increased lateral sway.\n     He now requires hand-held assistance on the 3 steps leading to the\n     outdoor play area, which he previously navigated independently.\n\n  3. DISENGAGEMENT EPISODES \u2014 INCREASED FREQUENCY AND DURATION:\n     Disengagement episodes have increased in both frequency and duration:\n\n       Period         Avg per 3-hr session    Avg duration\n       --------------------------------------------------------\n       Month 1        4-6                     5-15 seconds\n       Month 3        5-7                     8-15 seconds\n       Month 6        8-10                    10-20 seconds\n\n     Of significant concern: following these episodes, Eli now appears\n     briefly confused and takes 30-60 seconds to re-engage with the\n     therapeutic activity. During re-engagement, he often looks around the\n     room as if unfamiliar with his surroundings. On two occasions this\n     month, RBT Deshawn Carter observed what appeared to be subtle lip-\n     smacking movements during an episode.\n\n  4. PARENT REPORT: Mother (Denise Reeves) reports that Eli's nighttime\n     sleep has become disrupted. He wakes 2-3 times per week appearing\n     \"terrified and confused,\" sometimes crying inconsolably for 10-15\n     minutes. Mother also reports increased daytime staring episodes at\n     home, consistent with what is observed in the clinic.\n\nV. BCBA CLINICAL CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThis assessor discussed clinical observations with supervisor Dr. Amy\nOkonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D on 11/15/2016. The pattern of progressive skill\nloss across all domains, combined with the changing character of the\ndisengagement episodes, is atypical for our ASD client population. In this\nclinician's experience with over 40 ASD clients, loss of previously\nacquired skills of this magnitude over a 6-month period is not consistent\nwith typical ASD behavioral variability or adjustment-related regression.\n\nAdditionally, the disengagement episodes we are observing share features\nwith absence seizures as described in clinical literature, including:\nabrupt onset, unresponsiveness to stimuli, brief duration, and post-\nepisode confusion. The emerging lip-smacking automatism further raises\nconcern for seizure activity.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n  1. Medical follow-up for possible seizure activity \u2014 recommend neurology\n     referral and EEG evaluation\n  2. Medical evaluation for underlying cause of progressive skill regression\n  3. Continue ABA services pending medical evaluation\n  4.

Eli was\nreferred to our center with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2,\nand has been receiving 25 hours per week of ABA services under the supervision\nof a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.\n\nWe wish to bring to your attention a pattern of clinical observations that we\nbelieve warrants medical evaluation.\n\nSKILL REGRESSION\n\nOver the course of 6 months of intensive ABA therapy, Eli has demonstrated a\nclear and measurable pattern of skill regression across all developmental\ndomains assessed by the VB-MAPP. His total milestone score has declined from\n31.5 at intake to 22.5 at his most recent assessment \u2014 a 28.6% decrease. This\npattern is atypical for our ASD client population. In our clinical experience,\nclients receiving intensive ABA services either make progress or plateau; a\nsustained, multi-domain regression of this magnitude is unusual and, in our\nprofessional opinion, is not adequately explained by motivational factors,\nenvironmental change, or behavioral variability.\n\nSpecific areas of regression include:\n  - Fine motor: Loss of independent buttoning (present at intake, now absent).\n    Decline in pincer grasp strength and accuracy.\n  - Gross motor: Increased frequency of falls (0.8/session at intake to\n    3.2/session currently). Requires hand-held assistance on stairs that were\n    previously navigated independently. Gait has become more unsteady.\n  - Communication: Decrease in vocal mand repertoire (4 mands at 3-month\n    review, now 2 vocal mands). No new tacts acquired.\n  - Cognitive: Loss of color matching (4 colors to 2), loss of body part\n    identification (5 to 3).\n\nDISENGAGEMENT EPISODES\n\nWe have observed recurrent episodes of apparent disengagement that have\nincreased in frequency and duration over the course of treatment:\n\n  - Intake (May 2016): 4-6 episodes per 3-hour session, lasting 5-15 seconds\n  - Current (November 2016): 8-10 episodes per 3-hour session, lasting\n    10-20 seconds\n\nDuring these episodes, Eli ceases all motor activity, appears to stare\nblankly (sometimes with slight upward gaze deviation), and is unresponsive\nto his name, clapping, or light touch. Following each episode, he appears\ndisoriented for 30-60 seconds before resuming activity. On two recent\noccasions, subtle lip-smacking movements were observed during the episodes.\n\nThese episodes share features with absence seizures as described in clinical\nliterature. While we recognize that inattention and \"tuning out\" can occur in\nautism spectrum disorder, the clinical presentation \u2014 including the abrupt\nonset, complete unresponsiveness, post-episode confusion, increasing frequency,\nand emerging oral automatisms \u2014 is, in our assessment, not consistent with\nsimple behavioral inattention.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nWe respectfully recommend the following:\n  1. Neurological evaluation, including EEG, to rule out seizure disorder\n  2. Medical evaluation for potential underlying causes of progressive\n     developmental regression\n  3. We are happy to provide any additional behavioral data or clinical\n     observations that may be helpful in your evaluation\n\nWe appreciate your attention to these concerns and are available to discuss\nour observations at your convenience.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n_____________________________________\nJennifer Mallory, M.Ed., BCBA\nBoard Certified Behavior Analyst\nLicense #OH-BCBA-2014-1192\n\n_____________________________________\nAmy Okonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D\nClinical Director, Buckeye Behavioral Health\n\nCC: Patient chart (BBH-2016-0847)\n    Denise Reeves (parent, via hand delivery)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECORD 3.5 \u2014 TWELVE-MONTH PROGRESS REPORT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDATE OF REPORT:     05/22/2017\nREPORTING PERIOD:   11/21/2016 \u2013 05/19/2017\nCLIENT AGE:         5 years, 2 months\nSERVICE HOURS:      Authorized: 25 hrs/week | Delivered: 21.8 hrs/week average\n                    (reduced due to medical appointments and illness)\nTOTAL SESSIONS:     52 sessions this period (cumulative: 166 sessions)\nBCBA SUPERVISION:   Monthly + additional consultation sessions (6 sessions\n                    direct, 14 hours total this period)\n\nI. SUMMARY\n\nThis report documents continued and accelerating decline across all\ndevelopmental domains. Eli has now received 12 months of intensive ABA\ntherapy (approximately 560 total service hours). Despite modifications to\nprogramming, reinforcement strategies, instructional methods (transition\nfrom DTT-heavy to NET-heavy programming, introduction of PECS communication\nsystem, environmental modifications per OT consultation), no treatment goals\nhave been met and all VB-MAPP domain scores have continued to decline.\n\nII. GOAL PROGRESS\n\nAll original goals have been revised downward twice during the reporting\nperiod due to ongoing regression. Current status of revised goals:\n\nGoal 1 (revised): Eli will mand for 5 preferred items using any modality\n  (vocal, sign, or PECS) across 2 consecutive sessions.\n  Current: 2 vocal mands (\"mama,\" \"no\"); PECS use inconsistent (exchanges\n  picture for preferred item in 40% of opportunities, down from 60% when\n  PECS was introduced in month 8). Sign \"more\" no longer used.\n  Status: NOT MET \u2014 CONTINUED REGRESSION\n\nGoal 2 (revised): Eli will tact 5 common items using any modality.\n  Current: 1 consistent tact (\"ball\" \u2014 vocal). \"Cup\" and \"bubbles\"\n  no longer produced.\n  Status: NOT MET \u2014 CONTINUED REGRESSION\n\nGoal 3 (revised): Eli will follow 5 one-step instructions with 60%\n  accuracy.\n  Current: Follows 2 instructions (\"come here,\" \"sit down\") with\n  approximately 45% accuracy.\n  Status: NOT MET \u2014 CONTINUED REGRESSION\n\nGoal 4 (revised): Eli will imitate 5 gross motor actions.\n  Current: Imitates 1 action (clapping) with 40% accuracy. Previously\n  imitated actions (stomping, raising arms, waving) are no longer\n  performed.\n  Status: NOT MET \u2014 SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION\n\nGoal 5 (revised): Eli will participate in 2 self-care routines with\n  no more than 3 prompts per step.\n  Current: Requires full physical prompting for all self-care tasks.\n  Status: NOT MET \u2014 MAXIMUM REGRESSION ON THIS GOAL\n\nIII.

CRITICAL CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS\n\n  1. FINE MOTOR: Eli demonstrates a clear pattern of progressive fine motor\n     skill loss that is not consistent with typical ASD behavioral\n     trajectories. He can no longer button independently (skill present at\n     intake). Difficulty with pincer grasp tasks has worsened \u2014 he now uses\n     a raking grasp for small objects and frequently drops items. He can no\n     longer place pegs in a pegboard (mastered during month 2 of therapy).\n     Writing/drawing: at intake, Eli could produce a crude circular scribble;\n     he now makes only brief, irregular marks and frequently loses grip on\n     the crayon.\n\n  2. GROSS MOTOR: Gait has become significantly more ataxic over the past\n     6 months. Eli now walks with a wide base and notable lateral instability.\n     He requires hand-held assistance on stairs (previously independent\n     with railing). Falls have increased to an average of 4.8 per 3-hour\n     session. Running is no longer observed \u2014 Eli was able to run (clumsily\n     but independently) at intake; he now does not attempt to run. He\n     requires assistance transitioning from floor to standing.\n\n  3. DISENGAGEMENT EPISODES \u2014 CONTINUED ESCALATION:\n\n       Period              Avg per 3-hr session    Avg duration\n       -------------------------------------------------------\n       Intake (05/16)      4-6                     5-15 seconds\n       3-month (08/16)     5-7                     8-15 seconds\n       6-month (11/16)     8-10                    10-20 seconds\n       12-month (05/17)    12-15                   10-25 seconds\n\n     Episodes are now sometimes accompanied by subtle bilateral eye\n     fluttering lasting 2-5 seconds. Post-episode confusion has become\n     more pronounced \u2014 Eli now takes 1-2 minutes to re-engage following\n     longer episodes. On 3 occasions during this period, Eli slumped\n     slightly in his chair during an episode, suggesting possible brief\n     loss of postural tone.\n\n  4. PARENT REPORT: Mother reports continued nighttime wakings (now 4-5\n     times per week). Eli is \"harder to wake up in the morning\" and has\n     decreased appetite. Mother reports that family members who had not\n     seen Eli for several months were \"shocked\" by his decline. Maternal\n     grandmother stated: \"Something is wrong \u2014 this isn't just autism.\"\n\nV. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nClient demonstrates a clear pattern of skill loss that is not consistent\nwith typical ASD behavioral trajectories. Over 12 months of intensive ABA\nservices (approximately 560 hours), Eli has not acquired any new skills and\nhas lost the majority of skills present at intake. This degree of regression\ncannot be attributed to motivational factors, demand avoidance, environmental\nadjustment, or typical ASD behavioral variability.\n\nThis clinician reiterates and strengthens the recommendation made in our\nletter to Dr. Huang dated December 2, 2016: Eli requires comprehensive\nmedical and neurological evaluation. The progressive nature of the skill\nloss across motor, communicative, and cognitive domains, combined with the\nescalating disengagement episodes (which this clinician believes are\nconsistent with seizure activity), suggests an underlying medical condition\nthat may be separate from or in place of the ASD diagnosis.\n\nWe strongly recommend:\n  1. Urgent neurology referral with EEG\n  2. Comprehensive medical workup for causes of progressive developmental\n     regression\n  3. Consideration of metabolic, genetic, or neurodegenerative etiologies\n\n_____________________________________\nJennifer Mallory, M.Ed., BCBA\nDate: 05/22/2017\n\nReviewed by:\n_____________________________________\nAmy Okonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D\nClinical Director\nDate: 05/23/2017\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECORD 3.6 \u2014 DISCHARGE SUMMARY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDATE OF DISCHARGE:   07/15/2017\nCLIENT AGE:          5 years, 4 months (corrected: 5 years, 4 months)\nTOTAL LENGTH OF\n  SERVICE:           14 months (05/23/2016 \u2013 07/15/2017)\nTOTAL SERVICE HOURS: Approximately 672 hours of direct ABA therapy\nREASON FOR\n  DISCHARGE:         Parent-initiated.

DISCHARGE SUMMARY\n\nEli Reeves received 14 months of intensive ABA therapy (25 hours/week\nauthorized) at Buckeye Behavioral Health. Services were provided by RBT\nDeshawn Carter under the supervision of BCBA Jennifer Mallory, M.Ed., with\nclinical oversight by Dr. Amy Okonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D.\n\nII. TREATMENT OUTCOMES\n\nClient did not achieve any VB-MAPP milestones during 14 months of intensive\nABA therapy. A progressive decline in previously acquired skills was observed\nacross all developmental domains:\n\n                              Intake Score    Discharge Score    Change\n                              (05/2016)       (07/2017)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nVB-MAPP Milestone Total        31.5            10.0              -21.5\nMand                            3.5             1.0              -2.5\nTact                            2.0             0.5              -1.5\nListener Responding             5.0             1.0              -4.0\nVisual Perceptual / Match       5.5             1.5              -4.0\nMotor Imitation                 4.0             0.5              -3.5\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal VB-MAPP decline: 68.3% over 14 months.\n\nIII. CLINICAL STATEMENT\n\nThis pattern of sustained, progressive, multi-domain skill regression over\n14 months of intensive behavioral intervention is inconsistent with the\nexpected trajectory for ABA therapy in autism spectrum disorder. In the\nclinical experience of this BCBA (8 years, >40 ASD clients) and the\nsupervising BCBA-D (15 years, >150 ASD clients), we have not observed a\npattern of this nature in a client whose primary diagnosis is ASD.\n\nClients with ASD receiving intensive ABA therapy typically demonstrate either\nmeasurable skill acquisition or plateau. Sustained regression of this\nmagnitude \u2014 particularly the progressive loss of motor skills (fine and\ngross), the escalating disengagement episodes with seizure-like features,\nand the decline in cognitive/perceptual skills \u2014 warrants comprehensive\nmedical and neurological evaluation to identify a possible underlying\nneurodegenerative, metabolic, or genetic condition.\n\nIV. REFERRAL AND COORDINATION\n\n  - Letter sent to Dr. Patricia Huang (pediatrician) on 12/02/2016\n    documenting concerns \u2014 copy in chart\n  - Verbal communication with Dr. Huang's office on 01/15/2017 and\n    04/10/2017 reiterating concerns\n  - Neurology referral reported by parent to be pending\n  - Complete therapy records, data sheets, and VB-MAPP assessments\n    released to parent (Denise Reeves) upon signed authorization\n\nV. DISCHARGE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n  1. Comprehensive neurological evaluation including EEG\n  2. Medical workup for progressive developmental regression\n  3. Continued speech-language and occupational therapy services to\n     maintain current skill levels\n  4. If medical evaluation identifies a treatable condition and Eli\n     stabilizes or improves, ABA services may be reconsidered\n  5. Transition planning with school district for appropriate educational\n     placement and supports\n\n_____________________________________\nJennifer Mallory, M.Ed., BCBA\nBoard Certified Behavior Analyst\n\n_____________________________________\nAmy Okonkwo, Ph.D., BCBA-D\nClinical Director\n\nDate: 07/15/2017\n\n\n================================================================================\n                              PROVIDER 4\n          DR.

Per parent\nreport and ABA therapy progress notes (most recent report dated 11/21/2016\nfrom Buckeye Behavioral Health, BCBA Jennifer Mallory), Eli has not made\nexpected progress in ABA therapy and has demonstrated regression in several\nskill areas. Mother states: \"He's going backwards. He used to be able to do\nthings he can't do anymore.\"\n\nSpecific regression concerns per parent:\n  - Could dress himself with minimal help at age 4; now requires full\n    assistance with buttons and zippers\n  - Walking seems more unsteady \u2014 falls more often\n  - Verbal output has decreased \u2014 uses fewer words than 6 months ago\n  - Staring spells continue and have become \"worse and more frequent\"\n\nMother also reports significant sleep disturbance: Eli wakes 3-4 nights per\nweek appearing \"terrified and confused.\" He cries inconsolably for 10-15\nminutes after these episodes and does not seem to recognize his surroundings\ninitially. Episodes occur 1-3 hours after sleep onset. Mother denies\nwitnessing convulsive movements during these episodes but states she has\n\"not always been in the room when they start.\"\n\nAlso received letter from BCBA Jennifer Mallory (dated 12/02/2016)\nexpressing concern about progressive skill regression and recommending\nneurological evaluation for possible seizure activity.

No hepatosplenomegaly.\n  MSK: Toe-walking continues. Gait appears more unsteady than at\n    transfer visit \u2014 wider base, some lateral sway. Fell once during\n    exam (tripped transitioning from exam table to floor with step stool\n    assistance).\n  Neurological (screening):\n    - Hand-wringing stereotypy continues \u2014 appears more frequent than\n      prior visit\n    - Verbal output: 1 word heard during visit (\"mama\")\n    - Did not follow any verbal commands during exam\n    - Hypotonia continues \u2014 generalized, mild-moderate\n    - Reflexes: 2+ symmetric\n\n  During the examination, one staring episode was witnessed by this\n  provider. Duration approximately 10 seconds. Eli ceased movement, stared\n  ahead with slight upward gaze, and was unresponsive to name or clapping.\n  Resumed activity after approximately 10 seconds, appeared briefly\n  confused. No convulsive movements noted.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n  1. Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2 (F84.0)\n  2. Developmental regression \u2014 noted by ABA therapy center and confirmed\n     by parent report and clinical observation. Multiple domains affected\n     (motor, communication, adaptive).\n  3. Staring spells \u2014 witnessed in clinic today. Likely absence-type\n     episodes which can co-occur with ASD.\n  4. Sleep disturbance with nocturnal wakings (G47.9)\n  5. Toe-walking, bilateral (R26.0)\n  6. Growth: height and weight percentiles have declined since transfer\n     visit. Height 45th to 30th, weight 35th to 25th.\n\nPLAN:\n  1. History and exam consistent with ASD with moderate intellectual\n     disability. Some skill regression can occur in autism, particularly\n     during periods of stress and transition. Family has undergone\n     significant change with interstate move.\n  2. Staring spells noted \u2014 likely absence-type episodes which can\n     co-occur with ASD. Consider neurology referral if episodes increase\n     in frequency or duration, or if any convulsive movements are observed.\n  3. Sleep disturbance: discussed sleep hygiene measures. Melatonin\n     0.5 mg at bedtime may be trialed. If nocturnal episodes continue\n     with features concerning for seizures, will refer to neurology.\n  4. Growth deceleration: likely related to decreased appetite per parent\n     report. Will monitor. Ensure adequate caloric intake. Consider\n     nutritional supplementation (PediaSure or equivalent).\n  5. Continue ABA therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy.\n  6. BCBA concerns regarding regression acknowledged. Will monitor closely\n     at next visit. Neurology referral will be placed if regression\n     continues or staring spells worsen.\n  7. Immunizations: DTaP #5, IPV #4, MMR #2, Varicella #2 administered\n     today.\n  8.

BCBA LETTER: Mother received a copy of a follow-up letter from BCBA\n   Jennifer Mallory at Buckeye Behavioral Health (discharge summary dated\n   07/15/2017) reiterating recommendation for urgent neurological evaluation.\n   Mother wants to confirm that a neurology referral has been placed.\n\n   Response: Confirmed that neurology referral was placed on 07/14/2017\n   to Ohio Neurology Associates, marked as urgent. Per scheduling, the\n   earliest available new patient appointment with Dr. Robert Chen is\n   04/10/2018 \u2014 approximately 6 months from now. This is the current\n   wait time for new neurology patients.\n\n   UPDATE: After discussion, called Ohio Neurology Associates scheduling\n   to request earlier appointment given clinical urgency. Was informed\n   that a cancellation slot may open sooner and mother has been placed\n   on the cancellation list. Office will call mother directly if an\n   earlier appointment becomes available.\n\n2. SEIZURE CONCERN: Mother reports that last night Eli had an episode\n   during which he stopped moving, stared blankly for approximately\n   25 seconds, and then \"his arms twitched a couple of times\" before he\n   \"came back.\" This is the first time mother has observed any motor\n   component beyond eye fluttering. She is frightened and wants to know\n   if she should go to the ER.\n\n   Response: Discussed the episode in detail. The twitching was brief\n   (2-3 seconds per mother), self-limited, and Eli returned to baseline\n   (albeit confused) within 1-2 minutes. This does not constitute a\n   medical emergency but does add to the clinical urgency of the\n   neurology evaluation.\n\n   Advised: If any episode involves sustained convulsive movements (>30\n   seconds of rhythmic shaking), loss of consciousness with fall, or\n   failure to return to baseline within 5 minutes, call 911 or go to ER\n   immediately.\n\n   Mom expresses frustration: \"Six months to see a neurologist? He's\n   getting worse every week. I've been asking about this for over a year.\n   The ABA people told you something was wrong.

Per parent report,\n    Eli could dress himself with assistance at age 4. He now requires full\n    assistance with all dressing tasks. He cannot button or zip. He can no\n    longer put on his own shoes (previously could with help).\n  - MOTOR: Walking is notably more unsteady. Falls 2-3 times daily. Has\n    difficulty with stairs and requires hand-held assistance or railing.\n    He no longer runs. He trips over his own feet on flat surfaces.\n  - COMMUNICATION: Verbal output has decreased. Mother estimates he uses\n    approximately 5-8 single words (down from ~15-20 words at age 3-4).\n    He does not combine words.\n  - STARING EPISODES: Continue to occur multiple times daily (estimated\n    5-8 per day by parent). Duration typically 15-30 seconds. Post-episode\n    confusion lasting 1-2 minutes. Mother has observed occasional arm\n    twitching (2-3 seconds) during some episodes.\n  - SLEEP: Nighttime wakings continue 4-5 nights per week.\n  - NUTRITION: Appetite remains poor. Mother has been supplementing with\n    PediaSure per prior recommendation.\n  - ABA: Discontinued in July 2017 due to lack of progress. Eli continues\n    to receive school-based speech and OT services.\n  - NEUROLOGY: Appointment with Dr. Robert Chen scheduled for 04/10/2018\n    (next month) via Ohio Neurology Associates.

Eli now requires ankle-foot orthotics\n  (AFOs), fitted 09/2018 by orthopedics. Even with AFOs, gait remains\n  very unsteady. He can walk short distances (50-100 feet) with a walker\n  or hand-held assistance but fatigues quickly. Orthopedics has diagnosed\n  mild thoracolumbar scoliosis (Cobb angle 12 degrees, 10/2018 X-ray) and\n  is monitoring.\n\n  COMMUNICATION: Speech has decreased to mostly single words. Mother\n  estimates Eli now uses 3-5 words (\"mama,\" \"dada,\" \"no,\" \"help,\" and\n  sometimes \"more\"). He previously used 15-20 words at age 3-4 and\n  approximately 5-8 words at age 6. He does not combine words.\n\n  STARING EPISODES: Continue 2-3 times daily per parent. Duration\n  typically 15-30 seconds with post-episode confusion. Mother has\n  continued to observe occasional arm twitching. Mother states: \"I know\n  these are seizures. I've watched every video online. These are seizures.\"\n\n  SWALLOWING: Modified barium swallow study (08/2018) revealed mild\n  oropharyngeal dysphagia with delayed swallow initiation and trace\n  penetration with thin liquids. SLP recommended thickened liquids\n  (nectar consistency) and soft/chopped foods. Family is following\n  recommendations.\n\n  SLEEP: Nocturnal episodes continue but have decreased slightly in\n  frequency (2-3 nights per week, down from 4-5). Mother attributes\n  this to melatonin (now 1 mg at bedtime).\n\n  SCHOOL: Per IEP annual review (01/2019), Eli has not met any IEP goals\n  and has continued to lose previously mastered skills. School is\n  recommending a change in placement from inclusion classroom with 1:1\n  aide to a self-contained special education classroom.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n  Vitals:\n    Height: 46.5 inches (20th percentile) [continued decline: 45th at\n      4y2m, 30th at 5y, 25th at 6y, now 20th]\n    Weight: 44.0 lbs (15th percentile) [continued decline: 35th at\n      4y2m, 25th at 5y, 20th at 6y, now 15th]\n    BMI: 14.3 (15th percentile)\n    HR: 86 bpm\n    RR: 18\n    BP: 96/62 mmHg\n    Temp: 98.4 F\n    HC: 52.0 cm (50th percentile)\n\n  GROWTH TREND:\n    Age     Height %ile    Weight %ile    BMI %ile\n    4y2m    45th           35th           55th\n    5y0m    30th           25th           35th\n    6y0m    25th           20th           25th\n    7y0m    20th           15th           15th\n    Trend: Sustained progressive decline across all growth parameters.\n\n  General: Thin male, appears younger than stated age.

Per the aide's\nreport and my own observation upon arrival to the classroom (approximately\n2 minutes after onset):\n\n  - Eli was seated in his adapted chair at his desk\n  - He stopped all movement and became completely unresponsive\n  - His eyes appeared to flutter rapidly for approximately 10-15 seconds\n  - The episode lasted approximately 30 seconds total\n  - When he \"came back,\" he did not appear to know where he was for\n    about one minute \u2014 he looked around the room with a confused\n    expression and did not respond to his name or to Ms. Thompson\n  - He then began to cry quietly for approximately 2 minutes\n  - After approximately 3-4 minutes total, he returned to his baseline\n    level of alertness and engagement\n  - No convulsive movements were observed\n  - He did not fall from his chair\n  - His color remained normal throughout\n\nThis is the third such episode observed at school this month. Previous\nepisodes occurred on 11/05/2018 and 11/09/2018, each lasting approximately\n15-25 seconds with similar features. Staff are concerned that these may\nbe seizures.\n\nWe have documented these episodes in Eli's school health file. His IEP\nteam has been notified.\n\nWe are requesting medical guidance regarding:\n  1. Whether these episodes are seizures\n  2. What school staff should do when an episode occurs\n  3. Whether a seizure action plan should be developed for school\n  4. Whether any medication changes or evaluations are pending\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nKaren Delgado, RN, BSN\nSchool Nurse, Maple Grove Elementary\n\n---\n\nDR. HUANG'S RESPONSE (faxed 11/19/2018):\n\nDear Ms. Delgado,\n\nThank you for your detailed report regarding Eli Reeves. Your observations\nare consistent with the episodes his mother has been reporting and that\nI have witnessed in the office.\n\nEli has a history of these staring/unresponsive episodes. He was evaluated\nby a neurologist (Dr. Robert Chen, Ohio Neurology Associates) in April\n2018. An MRI of the brain was performed and did not show acute pathology.\nThe neurologist assessed the episodes as likely behavioral in nature in\nthe context of his autism diagnosis.\n\nHowever, given the increasing frequency and the features you describe\n(eye fluttering, post-episode confusion, crying), I share your concern\nthat these may represent seizure activity. I will recommend follow-up\nwith the neurologist regarding the increased frequency of episodes and\nwill request EEG evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, please implement the following school seizure\nprecautions:\n  1.

Records received include:\n  - Dr. Huang's new patient note (06/08/2016)\n  - Dr. Huang's 5-year well-child note (03/20/2017)\n  - Dr. Huang's sick visit note (07/14/2017)\n  - Dr. Huang's 6-year well-child note (03/19/2018)\n  - BCBA letter from Buckeye Behavioral Health (12/02/2016)\n  - CBC and blood lead results (03/2018)\n\nNOTE: Records prior to 06/2016 were not available for review. Per\nDr. Huang's notes, the patient was diagnosed with ASD at age 3.5 years\nin Virginia and had an MRI brain at age 3 that was reportedly normal. The\noriginal diagnostic evaluation, MRI report, and Virginia medical records\nwere not included in the materials received by this office.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nEli Reeves is a 6-year, 1-month-old biracial male with a diagnosis of\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (Level 2) who presents for neurological evaluation\nof developmental regression and staring spells.\n\nPer referral documentation and parent interview:\n\n  History of ASD: Diagnosed at age 3.5 years by a developmental pediatrician\n  in Virginia (Dr. Whitfield \u2014 records not available for review). Diagnosis\n  was based on limited speech, repetitive hand movements, and social\n  withdrawal. Per parent, MRI brain at age 3 was normal. Received ABA therapy\n  for approximately 14 months in Columbus (ages 4-5.5 years) with no progress\n  and apparent regression per ABA therapy reports.\n\n  Developmental regression: Per parent report and Dr. Huang's documentation,\n  Eli has demonstrated progressive loss of previously acquired skills over\n  the past 2 years. Mother reports he could dress himself with assistance,\n  button large buttons, use 15-20 words, and walk independently (though\n  unsteadily) at age 4. He now requires full assistance with dressing,\n  cannot button, uses approximately 5 single words, and walks only with\n  AFOs and hand-held support.\n\n  Staring spells: Per parent report, staring episodes have been present\n  since at least age 3-4. Episodes have increased in frequency (now 5-8\n  per day) and duration (now 15-30 seconds). During episodes, Eli ceases\n  all activity, stares ahead (sometimes with upward gaze deviation), and\n  is unresponsive to name or touch. Post-episode confusion lasts 1-2\n  minutes. Mother has recently observed occasional brief arm twitching\n  (2-3 seconds) at the end of some episodes. One episode was witnessed by\n  Dr. Huang during the 03/2018 well-child visit.\n\n  Nocturnal events: Eli wakes 3-5 nights per week appearing frightened and\n  disoriented. Episodes typically occur 1-3 hours after sleep onset.\n  Duration of confusion/distress: 10-20 minutes per mother. No witnessed\n  convulsive movements during nocturnal events, though mother acknowledges\n  she is not always present at onset.\n\n  Mother's concerns: \"Something else is going on besides autism. He is\n  losing abilities. Autistic kids are supposed to get better with therapy,\n  not worse. I think the staring spells are seizures.\"\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n  - ASD Level 2 (diagnosed age 3.5, Virginia)\n  - Late walking (26 months)\n  - MRI brain age 3: reportedly normal (report not available)\n  - No hospitalizations, no surgeries\n  - NKDA\n  - Medications: Melatonin 1 mg qhs\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n  - No known family history of epilepsy, seizure disorders, or\n    neurodegenerative conditions\n  - No consanguinity\n  - No other family members with ASD or intellectual disability per parent\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n  Neuro: As per HPI. Also \u2014 mother reports Eli is \"harder to wake up\"\n    in the mornings and seems \"more out of it\" generally compared to\n    1-2 years ago.\n  Vision: Mother has not noticed visual changes but Eli has not had a\n    formal eye exam (unable to cooperate). No obvious squinting or\n    head tilting.\n  GI: Poor appetite. On modified diet (thickened liquids, soft foods)\n    per SLP recommendation for mild dysphagia.\n  MSK: AFOs in place for bilateral ankle equinus. Mild scoliosis per\n    orthopedics.\n\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:\n\n  Mental Status: Eli is alert but appears less vigilant than expected for\n  age. He is seated in his mother's lap. He does not acknowledge the\n  examiner or respond to verbal greeting. He does not make eye contact.\n  He is cooperative with the examination in a passive manner \u2014 does not\n  resist but does not actively participate. Limited verbal interaction:\n  said \"mama\" once during the 40-minute encounter. Did not follow any\n  verbal commands during the examination. Continuous bilateral hand-\n  wringing stereotypy observed throughout.\n\n  Cranial Nerves:\n    CN II: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light bilaterally (3mm to\n      2mm). Visual fields: blinks to threat bilaterally, suggesting\n      intact peripheral fields grossly. Fundoscopic examination attempted\n      but limited by cooperation \u2014 brief view of right disc appeared\n      normal, left disc not adequately visualized.\n    CN III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements \u2014 eyes track a bright toy\n      through full horizontal range. Vertical tracking limited by\n      cooperation. No nystagmus observed in primary gaze or with\n      lateral gaze. No ptosis.\n    CN V: Facial sensation appears intact \u2014 withdraws to light touch\n      bilaterally. Masseter strength not formally tested.\n    CN VII: Face symmetric at rest and with crying (cried briefly during\n      fundoscopic attempt). Mild drooling noted \u2014 may suggest subtle\n      oromotor weakness.\n    CN VIII: Turns to sound bilaterally (clapped hands). Formal\n      audiometry not performed.\n    CN IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically. Gag reflex present\n      bilaterally. Voice (limited vocalizations): no hoarseness noted.\n    CN XI: SCM and trapezius strength not formally tested \u2014 appears\n      symmetric.\n    CN XII: Tongue midline on protrusion (brief, observed during cry).\n      No fasciculations.\n\n  Motor:\n    Bulk: Mildly decreased muscle bulk globally, particularly in\n      distal lower extremities.\n    Tone:\n      Upper extremities: Decreased tone (hypotonia) bilaterally.\n        Mild but definite.\n      Lower extremities: Mildly increased tone (spasticity) bilaterally,\n        greater in ankle plantarflexors. Velocity-dependent. Bilateral\n        ankle equinus contracture present.\n    Strength: Formal manual muscle testing not possible due to limited\n      cooperation. Observed functional strength:\n      - Able to lift arms against gravity and sustain briefly (4/5\n        estimated)\n      - Able to kick legs against gravity (4/5 estimated)\n      - Grip: weak, unable to sustain grasp on examiner's finger for\n        >2 seconds\n      - No obvious asymmetry\n\n  Reflexes:\n    Biceps:     2+ bilaterally\n    Triceps:    2+ bilaterally\n    Patellar:   3+ bilaterally (brisk)\n    Achilles:   3+ bilaterally (brisk), with 2-3 beats of clonus\n                bilaterally (unsustained)\n    Plantar:    Equivocal bilaterally (difficult to interpret given\n                contracture and withdrawal response)\n\n  Coordination:\n    Finger-nose testing attempted: Eli reached toward the examiner's\n    finger with a toy as target. Marked dysmetria observed \u2014 overshooting\n    by approximately 3-4 cm on multiple attempts. Intention tremor\n    noted in the terminal phase of reaching.\n    Poor pincer grasp for age \u2014 unable to pick up a small bead; uses\n    crude raking grasp.\n    Rapid alternating movements: not testable due to cooperation.\n\n  Gait:\n    Observed with AFOs in place and mother holding one hand. Wide-based\n    gait with significant lateral sway. Steps are short and shuffling.\n    Bilateral toe-walking despite AFOs. Occasional foot-dragging noted,\n    left > right. Eli took approximately 15 steps before requiring a\n    rest. Without mother's hand, took 2 steps then lost balance\n    (caught by mother).\n    Heel walking: unable.\n    Tandem gait: unable.\n    Romberg: unable to assess due to cooperation and inability to stand\n    with feet together.\n\n  Stereotypic hand-wringing movements observed continuously throughout\n  the examination. These are rhythmic, bilateral, and occur at midline.\n  They appear involuntary and are not suppressible with distraction.\n\n  During the examination, one staring episode was witnessed. At\n  approximately the 25-minute mark, Eli suddenly ceased hand-wringing,\n  became motionless, and stared ahead with subtle upward gaze deviation.\n  Episode lasted approximately 12 seconds. He was unresponsive to\n  name, clapping, and light touch on the shoulder during the episode.\n  Following the episode, he appeared confused \u2014 looked around the room,\n  appeared not to recognize his surroundings, and took approximately\n  60 seconds to resume baseline behavior (hand-wringing, looking around).\n  No convulsive movements were observed during this episode.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n\nEli is a 6-year, 1-month-old male with a diagnosis of ASD Level 2 who\npresents with parental and provider concerns regarding developmental\nregression and recurrent staring spells.\n\nNeurological examination is notable for:\n  1. Generalized mild hypotonia (upper > lower)\n  2. Mild spasticity in lower extremities with ankle equinus contracture\n  3. Brisk patellar and Achilles reflexes with unsustained ankle clonus\n  4. Dysmetria and intention tremor on reaching\n  5. Wide-based, ataxic gait requiring assistive support\n  6. Poor fine motor skills with weak grip\n  7. Continuous stereotypic hand-wringing\n  8. Minimal verbal output\n  9. Witnessed staring episode with post-episode confusion\n\nRegarding the staring spells: The differential diagnosis includes absence\nseizures versus behavioral inattention/dissociation, which is commonly\nobserved in patients with ASD. The episode witnessed during today's visit\nwas brief (12 seconds), non-convulsive, and self-limited. The post-episode\nconfusion, while concerning, can also be seen with behavioral dissociative\nepisodes in neurodevelopmental disorders. Given the brief, non-convulsive\nnature, I will obtain an MRI of the brain to evaluate for structural causes\nof the regression and staring spells. If the MRI is unrevealing and\nepisodes worsen (increased frequency, increased duration, or development\nof convulsive features), I will proceed with EEG evaluation.\n\nThe developmental regression is concerning but may be attributable to the\nnatural history of ASD in the setting of moderate-severe intellectual\ndisability. Some degree of skill loss or plateau is not uncommon in this\npopulation, particularly in the context of limited therapeutic response.\n\nICD-10 CODES:\n  F84.0  \u2014 Autistic disorder\n  R40.4  \u2014 Transient alteration of awareness (staring spells)\n  R62.59 \u2014 Other and unspecified lack of expected normal physiological\n            development (developmental regression)\n  R26.0  \u2014 Ataxic gait\n  G80.0  \u2014 Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy \u2014 rule out (pending imaging)\n\nPLAN:\n  1. MRI Brain without and with contrast \u2014 ordered (scheduling to follow).\n     Evaluate for structural abnormalities, white matter disease,\n     posterior fossa pathology, or other causes of regression and ataxia.\n  2. Laboratory studies: not ordered at this time. Basic labs (CBC, lead)\n     recently normal per Dr. Huang. If MRI demonstrates abnormalities\n     suggestive of metabolic disease, will order targeted metabolic workup.\n  3. EEG: will consider if MRI is unrevealing and staring spells worsen\n     or develop convulsive features. At this time, the brief, non-\n     convulsive nature of the episodes does not mandate emergent EEG.\n  4. Return to clinic after MRI for review of results and further planning.\n  5. In the interim: continue current supports (AFOs, school services,\n     dysphagia precautions). If any convulsive seizure activity or\n     prolonged episode (>2 minutes), present to ED.\n\n_____________________________________\nRobert Chen, MD\nBoard Certified \u2014 Neurology\nSpecial Qualification in Child Neurology\nOhio Neurology Associates\nDate: 04/10/2018\n\nDictated: 04/10/2018\nTranscribed: 04/12/2018\nCC: Dr. Patricia Huang, MD (via fax)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECORD 5.2 \u2014 MRI BRAIN RADIOLOGY REPORT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                     OHIO NEUROLOGY ASSOCIATES\n              IMAGING CENTER \u2014 RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT\n                 6750 Perimeter Drive, Suite 100\n                     Columbus, OH 43229\n\nRADIOLOGY REPORT\n\nPATIENT:           Eli Reeves\nDOB:               03/15/2012\nMRN:               ONA-18-02491\nDATE OF EXAM:      04/24/2018\nPATIENT AGE:       6 years, 1 month\nORDERING PROVIDER: Robert Chen, MD\nREADING RADIOLOGIST: Dr. Sunita Patel, MD\n                     Board Certified \u2014 Neuroradiology\n\nEXAMINATION: MRI Brain without and with contrast\n\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Autism spectrum disorder with developmental regression,\nstaring spells, ataxic gait. Evaluate for structural pathology.\n\nTECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed on a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Magnetom\nAera scanner without and with intravenous administration of 4 mL Gadavist\n(gadobutrol) contrast. Sedation was administered by pediatric anesthesiology\n(propofol) for the duration of the study due to inability to cooperate\nwith the examination.\n\nSequences obtained:\n  - Sagittal T1-weighted (pre- and post-contrast)\n  - Axial T1-weighted (pre- and post-contrast)\n  - Axial T2-weighted\n  - Axial FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)\n  - Axial DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) with ADC map\n  - Axial SWI (susceptibility-weighted imaging)\n  - Coronal T2-weighted\n\nCOMPARISON: No prior imaging available at this facility. Per clinical\nhistory, patient reportedly had an MRI at age 3 (2015) at an outside\nfacility that was normal. Outside images were not available for comparison.\n\nFINDINGS:\n\n  Ventricles and CSF Spaces:\n    - Lateral ventricles are mildly prominent, left slightly greater than\n      right. The ventricular configuration is smooth without irregular\n      margins. The frontal horns, bodies, and occipital horns are mildly\n      dilated.\n    - Third ventricle: upper limits of normal in size (6 mm).\n    - Fourth ventricle: normal in size and configuration.\n    - No periventricular signal abnormality on FLAIR to suggest\n      transependymal CSF flow or acute hydrocephalus.\n    - Cerebral sulci are within normal limits for age.\n\n  Cerebral Hemispheres:\n    - Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved.\n    - No focal signal abnormality in the cerebral white matter on T2\n      or FLAIR sequences.\n    - No restricted diffusion on DWI/ADC to suggest acute ischemia.\n    - No abnormal enhancement following contrast administration.\n    - Cortical thickness and gyral pattern appear normal.\n    - No heterotopia or cortical malformation identified.\n\n  Cerebellum:\n    - Cerebellar hemispheres appear grossly normal in signal intensity.\n    - Cerebellar folia are within normal limits for age.\n    - No focal lesion.\n    - Vermis is intact.\n    NOTE: In retrospective review, cerebellar volume may be at the lower\n    end of normal for age; however, without prior comparison imaging\n    available at this facility, this cannot be definitively assessed as\n    abnormal. The cerebellar appearance is within the range of normal\n    variation for a 6-year-old.\n\n  Brainstem:\n    - Normal in size and signal intensity.\n    - No focal lesion.\n\n  Corpus Callosum:\n    - Intact. Normal thickness and signal intensity throughout.\n\n  Sella/Pituitary:\n    - Normal.\n\n  Extra-axial Spaces:\n    - No extra-axial collection or mass.\n    - No midline shift.\n\n  Skull and Orbits:\n    - Normal calvarium. No fracture.\n    - Orbits are normal. Globes are symmetric.\n\n  Vascular:\n    - Major intracranial vessels demonstrate normal flow voids.\n    - No vascular malformation identified.\n\n  Post-Contrast:\n    - No abnormal parenchymal or meningeal enhancement.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n  1. Mildly prominent lateral ventricles, left slightly greater than\n     right, likely representing a developmental variant. No imaging\n     features to suggest obstructive hydrocephalus.\n  2. No acute intracranial pathology.\n  3. No white matter signal abnormality to suggest leukodystrophy or\n     demyelinating process.\n  4. No posterior fossa abnormality.\n  5. No mass lesion. No abnormal enhancement.\n  6. Clinical correlation recommended.\n\nNOTE: If clinical concern for neurodegenerative process persists,\ncomparison with prior outside imaging (reportedly obtained at age 3)\nis recommended, as interval changes may be subtle and not appreciable\non a single study without comparison.\n\n_____________________________________\nSunita Patel, MD\nBoard Certified \u2014 Neuroradiology\nOhio Neurology Associates Imaging Center\nDate: 04/25/2018\n\nDictated: 04/24/2018\nFinalized: 04/25/2018\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECORD 5.3 \u2014 FOLLOW-UP LETTER TO DR.

Neurological examination was notable for\ngeneralized mild hypotonia in the upper extremities, mild spasticity in the\nlower extremities with ankle equinus contracture, brisk lower extremity\nreflexes with unsustained ankle clonus, and an ataxic, wide-based gait\nrequiring support. Fine motor skills were impaired, with poor pincer grasp\nand weak grip. Continuous stereotypic hand-wringing was observed. Verbal\noutput was markedly limited (one word during the encounter). One staring\nepisode was witnessed during the visit, lasting approximately 12 seconds,\nwithout convulsive features, with brief post-episode confusion.\n\nMRI of the brain performed on April 24, 2018 demonstrates mildly prominent\nlateral ventricles that are most likely a developmental variant. There is\nno evidence of acute intracranial pathology, white matter disease,\nposterior fossa abnormality, or mass lesion. The MRI does not demonstrate\na structural cause for the developmental regression or staring episodes.\n\nGiven the absence of structural pathology on imaging and the well-\nestablished diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, the staring spells\nare most likely behavioral in nature \u2014 representing episodes of inattention\nor dissociation that are commonly observed in individuals with ASD and\nintellectual disability. The developmental regression, while concerning, may\nreflect the natural trajectory of ASD with moderate intellectual disability,\nwhere some skill loss or plateau can occur particularly in the context of\nenvironmental change and limited therapeutic response.\n\nI recommend continued monitoring of the staring episodes. If the episodes\nincrease significantly in frequency or duration, if any convulsive activity\nis observed (tonic stiffening, clonic jerking, loss of consciousness with\nfall), or if the family or school reports a marked escalation in symptoms,\nplease re-refer for EEG evaluation. At this time, given the clinical\npresentation and normal structural imaging, I do not believe emergent EEG\nis indicated.\n\nIf the developmental regression continues to progress, consideration may\nbe given to metabolic or genetic evaluation, though the current clinical\npicture is most consistent with ASD-related regression.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to participate in Eli's care. Please do not\nhesitate to contact my office if further questions or concerns arise.\n\nSincerely,\n\n_____________________________________\nRobert Chen, MD\nBoard Certified \u2014 Neurology\nSpecial Qualification in Child Neurology\nOhio Neurology Associates\n\nDate: 05/03/2018\n\nDictated: 05/01/2018\nTranscribed: 05/03/2018\nCC: Patient chart\n\n\n================================================================================\n                          SCHOOL RECORDS\n              MAPLE GROVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL \u2014 COLUMBUS, OH\n                   4500 Eastwood Avenue\n                   Columbus, OH 43227\n                Phone: (614) 555-0475 Fax: (614) 555-0478\n             Franklin County Educational Service Center\n================================================================================\n\nSTUDENT:          Eli Reeves\nDOB:              03/15/2012\nSTUDENT ID:       MG-2016-2847\nGRADE:            Preschool (2016-2017), Kindergarten (2017-2018),\n                  1st Grade (2018-2019)\nPARENT/GUARDIAN:  Denise Reeves (mother), Marcus Reeves (father)\nADDRESS:          1247 Woodland Park Drive, Columbus, OH 43227\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECORD S.1 \u2014 INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM (IEP) \u2014 INITIAL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIEP MEETING DATE:         11/14/2016\nIEP EFFECTIVE DATES:      11/14/2016 \u2013 11/13/2017\nSTUDENT AGE:              4 years, 8 months\nGRADE PLACEMENT:          Preschool \u2014 Inclusive Early Childhood Program\nDISABILITY CATEGORY:      Autism (Primary)\nETR (EVALUATION TEAM\n  REPORT) DATE:           10/28/2016\nIEP TEAM MEMBERS:\n  - Denise Reeves (parent)\n  - Lauren Mitchell, M.Ed.

PRESENT LEVELS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE\n\n  A. Communication:\n     Eli communicates primarily through gestures (reaching, leading by\n     hand) and limited vocalizations. He uses approximately 8-10\n     recognizable words inconsistently (\"mama,\" \"dada,\" \"no,\" \"more,\"\n     \"go,\" \"juice,\" \"ball,\" \"bye,\" \"up,\" \"help\"). He does not combine\n     words into phrases. He does not respond consistently to his name\n     (approximately 30% of the time). He follows simple one-step\n     directions inconsistently (approximately 50% of the time for\n     familiar, routine directions such as \"sit down\" or \"come here\").\n     He does not answer questions. He does not engage in conversational\n     turn-taking.\n     Per SLP assessment (10/2016): receptive language age equivalent\n     approximately 12-14 months; expressive language age equivalent\n     approximately 10-12 months.\n\n  B. Social/Emotional:\n     Eli does not initiate social interactions with peers or unfamiliar\n     adults. He will occasionally seek proximity to familiar adults\n     (mother, 1:1 aide). He does not engage in cooperative or parallel\n     play. He shows minimal awareness of peers in the classroom. He does\n     not share, take turns, or imitate peers. He cries when overstimulated\n     (loud noises, crowded spaces) but is generally calm in structured,\n     predictable environments.\n\n  C. Motor Skills:\n     Fine motor: Eli demonstrates a crude palmar grasp on writing\n     instruments. He can stack 3-4 blocks. He can turn pages of a board\n     book (one at a time, with effort). He can button large buttons on a\n     dressing frame (inconsistent \u2014 succeeds approximately 60% of\n     attempts). He has difficulty with small manipulatives (beads, pegs).\n     Per OT assessment: fine motor skills approximately 18-24 month level.\n\n     Gross motor: Eli walks independently with a wide-based gait and\n     intermittent bilateral toe-walking. He navigates stairs with railing\n     and step-to pattern. He falls approximately 2-3 times per school day\n     during transitions. He does not run smoothly \u2014 attempts to run\n     result in stumbling. He can climb onto child-sized furniture. He\n     does not jump, hop, or skip.\n     Per OT assessment: gross motor skills approximately 20-26 month level.\n\n  D. Adaptive Behavior:\n     Eli requires assistance with most self-care tasks. He can wash his\n     hands with 1-2 verbal prompts. He feeds himself with a spoon (some\n     spillage). He drinks from an open cup with occasional spilling. He\n     is not toilet trained. He requires assistance with dressing but can\n     pull up elastic-waist pants with help and button large buttons\n     (inconsistently). He does not manage zippers or snaps.\n\n  E. Cognitive/Academic:\n     Eli matches 4 colors (red, blue, yellow, green) on a field of 3.\n     He identifies 5 body parts (head, eyes, nose, mouth, hands). He\n     sorts objects by one attribute (color or shape, not both). He does\n     not identify letters, numbers, or shapes by name. He does not count\n     objects. He attends to structured activities for approximately\n     2-3 minutes before disengaging.\n     Per school psychologist assessment: cognitive functioning estimated\n     in the 60-75 range (mild to moderate intellectual disability).\n\n  F. Health/Medical:\n     Per school nurse and parent report: Eli experiences staring episodes\n     (4-6 per day, lasting 5-15 seconds) with brief post-episode\n     confusion. Medical evaluation is ongoing. No formal seizure diagnosis.\n     See Health Plan.\n     Bilateral toe-walking \u2014 no orthotics at this time.\n     Behavioral health: ABA therapy at Buckeye Behavioral Health\n     (25 hrs/week, outside school hours).\n\nII.

REVIEW OF ANNUAL GOALS \u2014 PROGRESS SUMMARY\n\n  Goal 1 \u2014 Communication (Expressive): Mand for 10 items across settings\n    Status: NOT MET\n    Progress: At this time, Eli mands for approximately 3 items using\n    single words (\"mama,\" \"no,\" \"more\"), DOWN from baseline of 4-6 mands.\n    PECS was introduced in January 2017; Eli used PECS to exchange pictures\n    for 4 items by May 2017 but has since regressed \u2014 currently exchanges\n    for 1-2 items inconsistently. REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.\n\n  Goal 2 \u2014 Communication (Receptive): Follow 10 one-step directions\n    Status: NOT MET\n    Progress: Eli follows approximately 2 one-step directions (\"come here,\"\n    \"sit down\") with 40% accuracy. This is a DECLINE from baseline (5\n    directions, 50% accuracy). He no longer responds to several directions\n    he previously followed (e.g., \"give me the ___,\" \"put it in\").\n    REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.\n\n  Goal 3 \u2014 Social Skills: Parallel play for 3 minutes\n    Status: NOT MET\n    Progress: Eli tolerates peer proximity for approximately 15-20 seconds.\n    He does not engage in parallel play. Minimal change from baseline but\n    no regression. NO PROGRESS.\n\n  Goal 4 \u2014 Fine Motor: Pincer grasp for small objects\n    Status: NOT MET\n    Progress: Eli's fine motor skills have DECLINED. He is no longer able\n    to use a pincer grasp consistently. He relies on a raking/palmar grasp\n    for most objects. He can no longer button large buttons on a dressing\n    frame (this was present at baseline but has been LOST). He has\n    difficulty holding a crayon and makes only brief, uncontrolled marks.\n    SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.\n\n  Goal 5 \u2014 Gross Motor / Stairs: Navigate 4 stairs with railing\n    Status: NOT MET\n    Progress: Eli's gross motor skills have DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY. He now\n    requires hand-over-hand assistance on all stairs (previously used\n    railing with step-to pattern independently). He falls approximately\n    4-6 times per school day (up from 2-3 at baseline). His gait has\n    become more unsteady with visible lateral sway. He no longer attempts\n    to run. He requires assistance transitioning from floor to standing.\n    SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.\n\n  Goal 6 \u2014 Adaptive / Hand Washing: Independent 3-step routine\n    Status: NOT MET\n    Progress: Eli now requires full physical assistance for hand washing.\n    He previously completed the routine with 1-2 verbal prompts at\n    baseline. He is less responsive to verbal prompts across all\n    adaptive routines. REGRESSION FROM BASELINE.\n\n  SUMMARY: Eli has not met any of his six annual IEP goals. Of greater\n  concern, he has lost previously mastered skills across multiple domains.\n  Goals from the initial IEP period that were marked as \"baseline/emerging\n  skills\" at the start of the year are now below baseline or absent.\n  Specifically:\n    - Expressive mands: declined from 4-6 to 3\n    - Receptive directions: declined from 5 at 50% to 2 at 40%\n    - Buttoning: present at baseline, now absent\n    - Stair navigation: independent with railing at baseline, now\n      requires hand-over-hand assistance\n    - Hand washing: 1-2 prompts at baseline, now full physical assistance\n\n  The IEP team expresses significant concern about this pattern of\n  regression and recommends comprehensive re-evaluation.\n\nII. UPDATED PRESENT LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE\n\n  Communication: Eli now uses approximately 3-4 single words. He does not\n  combine words. PECS use has declined. He follows 2 familiar directions\n  inconsistently. SLP reports receptive language has declined from\n  approximately 12-14 month equivalent to approximately 10-12 month\n  equivalent. Expressive language has declined from approximately 10-12\n  month equivalent to approximately 8-10 month equivalent.\n\n  Motor: Fine motor has declined from approximately 18-24 month level to\n  approximately 12-16 month level per OT. Gross motor has declined from\n  approximately 20-26 month level to approximately 14-18 month level per\n  OT. Eli now has near-constant toe-walking and significantly unsteady\n  gait. He is being evaluated for AFOs per medical provider.\n\n  Adaptive: Eli requires maximum assistance for all self-care tasks. He\n  has lost the ability to button, use a spoon effectively (now frequently\n  drops spoon; finger-feeding or adult-assisted feeding for most meals),\n  and wash hands independently.\n\n  Cognitive: Eli no longer matches colors consistently (previously matched\n  4; now matches 1 \u2014 red \u2014 inconsistently). He no longer identifies body\n  parts on command. He does not sort objects. Attention to structured\n  activities has decreased to approximately 30-60 seconds before\n  disengagement.\n\n  Staring episodes: Per school nurse documentation, staring episodes occur\n  approximately 4-8 times per school day, lasting 10-25 seconds, with\n  post-episode confusion of 1-3 minutes. Eye fluttering has been observed\n  during some episodes. Medical evaluation is ongoing (MRI scheduled per\n  parent).\n\nIII. REVISED ANNUAL GOALS (2018-2019)\n\n  [Goals revised downward to reflect current functioning levels. All goals\n  are written as maintenance or minimal-acquisition targets given pattern\n  of regression.]\n\n  Goal 1 \u2014 Communication: Eli will use any modality (word, sign, PECS,\n  gesture) to request 5 preferred items/activities with 60% accuracy\n  across 3 data days.\n  Baseline: 3 mands (words)\n\n  Goal 2 \u2014 Motor Safety: Eli will walk independently (with AFOs when\n  fitted) for a distance of 50 feet in the school hallway with no more\n  than 1 fall, across 4 of 5 opportunities.\n  Baseline: Falls 4-6x/day; requires hand support for hallway travel\n\n  Goal 3 \u2014 Adaptive: Eli will participate in a 3-step self-care routine\n  (hand washing, tooth brushing, or face washing) with no more than\n  partial physical assistance at each step, across 3 of 5 opportunities.\n  Baseline: Requires full physical assistance\n\n  Goal 4 \u2014 Engagement: Eli will attend to a structured tabletop activity\n  for 2 continuous minutes without a disengagement episode, across 3 of\n  5 opportunities.\n  Baseline: Attention span approximately 30-60 seconds with frequent\n  disengagement episodes\n\nIV.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nEli Reeves is a 6-year, 0-month-old biracial (Black/White) male currently\nenrolled in kindergarten at Maple Grove Elementary School. He receives\nspecial education services under the disability category of Autism, with\nan IEP in place since November 2016.\n\nEli was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2, at age 3 years,\n6 months by Dr. Marcus Whitfield at Blue Ridge Developmental Pediatrics\nin Roanoke, Virginia. At that time, a Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler\nDevelopment, Third Edition (Bayley-III) was administered (age 3 years,\n5 months), yielding the following composite scores:\n  - Cognitive: 72 (3rd percentile \u2014 borderline)\n  - Language: 62 (1st percentile \u2014 extremely low)\n  - Motor: 68 (2nd percentile \u2014 extremely low)\n\nThe family relocated to Columbus, Ohio in May 2016. Eli received intensive\nABA therapy (25 hrs/week) at Buckeye Behavioral Health from May 2016 to\nJuly 2017. Per ABA discharge summary, Eli did not make progress and\ndemonstrated \"progressive decline in previously acquired skills across\nall developmental domains.\"\n\nSince enrollment at Maple Grove Elementary (Fall 2016), the IEP team has\ndocumented progressive regression in communication, motor, adaptive, and\ncognitive skills. Eli has not met any IEP goals and has lost multiple\nbaseline skills. The IEP team requested this re-evaluation to determine\ncurrent cognitive functioning and to investigate the nature and extent of\nthe regression.\n\nII. EVALUATION PROCEDURES\n\nThe following assessments and procedures were utilized:\n\n  1. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V)\n     \u2014 partial administration\n  2. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3)\n     \u2014 Parent/Caregiver Rating Form (completed by Denise Reeves)\n  3. Review of educational records, IEP documentation, and ABA therapy\n     records\n  4. Behavioral observations during testing\n  5. Teacher interview (Lauren Mitchell, M.Ed.; Brian Kowalski)\n  6. Parent interview (Denise Reeves)\n\nIII. BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS DURING TESTING\n\nTesting was conducted over two sessions (03/12/2018 and 03/14/2018)\nin the school psychology office. Eli was accompanied to the testing room\nby his 1:1 aide (Ms. Thompson). He walked with a wide-based, unsteady\ngait; the aide held his hand for support.\n\nEli did not acknowledge the examiner or make eye contact during either\nsession. He sat in an adapted chair with lateral supports. Continuous\nbilateral hand-wringing was observed throughout both sessions.\n\nEli's verbal output during testing was extremely limited \u2014 he said \"no\"\ntwice and \"mama\" once across both sessions. He did not respond to verbal\ndirections or questions from the examiner.\n\nMultiple staring episodes were observed: 6 episodes across the two\ntesting sessions (total testing time approximately 90 minutes). Episodes\nlasted 10-25 seconds. During episodes, Eli became completely motionless\nand unresponsive. Eye fluttering was observed during 3 of the 6 episodes.\nPost-episode, Eli appeared disoriented for 1-3 minutes. These episodes\nsignificantly impacted the testing process.\n\nEli demonstrated very limited engagement with test materials. He\noccasionally looked at picture stimuli but did not point, verbalize, or\notherwise indicate responses to most items. When physically guided to\nmanipulate blocks or objects, he had difficulty maintaining grasp and\ndropped materials frequently.\n\nGiven the significant limitations in Eli's ability to engage with\nstandardized testing procedures, only a partial WISC-V administration was\npossible. Results should be interpreted as an ESTIMATE of cognitive\nfunctioning and may UNDERESTIMATE Eli's true abilities due to the\nconfounding effects of motor impairment, communication limitation, and\npossible seizure activity during testing.\n\nIV. COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT \u2014 WISC-V (PARTIAL ADMINISTRATION)\n\nThe following subtests were attempted:\n\n  Subtest                  Attempted    Completed    Scaled Score\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------\n  Block Design             Yes          Partial      (1)*\n  Similarities             Yes          No           Unable to score\n  Matrix Reasoning         Yes          Partial      (2)*\n  Digit Span               Yes          No           Unable to score\n  Coding                   Yes          No           Unable to score\n  Vocabulary               Yes          No           Unable to score\n  Figure Weights           No           ---          ---\n  Visual Puzzles           Yes          Partial      (1)*\n  Picture Span             Yes          Partial      (2)*\n  Symbol Search            Yes          No           Unable to score\n\n  * Scores in parentheses represent estimated scaled scores based on\n    partial administration.

Extremely Low\n\n  SCORE CHANGE: Decline of approximately 14 standard score points\n  (approximately 1 standard deviation) over a 2.5-year period.\n\n  INTERPRETATION: While some degree of score difference between the\n  Bayley-III and WISC-V is expected due to differences in test construction,\n  norms, and the skills assessed, the magnitude of the decline observed\n  here (>1 SD) is unusual and exceeds what would be expected from\n  instrument differences alone. Research on Bayley-III to WISC-V prediction\n  suggests that Bayley cognitive scores tend to slightly overestimate later\n  IQ scores by approximately 3-7 points in children with developmental\n  delays. Even accounting for this, the observed decline of 14 points is\n  notable and suggests genuine loss of cognitive abilities.\n\n  This pattern of cognitive decline, combined with the documented regression\n  in motor, communication, and adaptive skills across ABA therapy records,\n  IEP progress monitoring, and clinical observation, represents a\n  significant and concerning trajectory.\n\nVII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nEli Reeves is a 6-year-old male with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum\nDisorder who demonstrates significant cognitive, communicative, motor,\nand adaptive deficits. Current estimated cognitive functioning falls in\nthe Extremely Low range (estimated FSIQ 58), representing a meaningful\ndecline from his Bayley-III cognitive score of 72 obtained 2.5 years ago.\n\nOf primary concern is the pattern of progressive skill regression\ndocumented by multiple sources (ABA therapy, IEP progress data, parent\nreport, clinical observation) across all developmental domains. This\nregression is significant in both scope (affecting motor, communication,\ncognitive, and adaptive domains simultaneously) and magnitude (loss of\nmultiple previously acquired skills including buttoning, stair navigation,\ncolor matching, and multiple receptive language tasks).\n\nWhile some degree of regression can occur in some presentations of autism\nspectrum disorder \u2014 particularly during periods of transition or stress,\nand some ASD subtypes (e.g., regressive autism) involve an early period\nof skill loss typically occurring between 15-24 months \u2014 the ongoing,\nprogressive, multi-year pattern of skill loss observed in Eli is atypical\nfor ASD. In most cases of regressive autism, the regression occurs in early\ntoddlerhood and is followed by a plateau or gradual skill re-acquisition,\nnot by continued progressive decline through school age.\n\nThe school psychologist notes the following concerns that warrant\nmedical investigation:\n\n  1. The progressive, multi-domain nature of the regression (motor,\n     cognitive, communicative, adaptive) occurring over a 2+ year period\n     and continuing at age 6 years\n  2. The significant decline in cognitive scores (estimated 14-point\n     decrease) exceeding what would be expected from assessment instrument\n     differences\n  3. The staring episodes observed during testing, which have features\n     concerning for seizure activity (abrupt onset, unresponsiveness,\n     eye fluttering, post-episode confusion)\n  4. The progressive motor deterioration (gait instability, loss of fine\n     motor skills, emerging spasticity per medical records) which is not\n     a typical feature of ASD\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  1. EDUCATIONAL: Change in disability category should be considered.\n     While Autism remains appropriate as a primary category, the IEP team\n     should consider adding \"Multiple Disabilities\" or \"Traumatic Brain\n     Injury/Other Health Impairment\" as the presentation evolves and\n     additional medical information becomes available.\n\n  2. EDUCATIONAL: Change in placement recommended \u2014 from inclusive\n     kindergarten with 1:1 aide to self-contained special education\n     classroom (multiple disabilities unit) with reduced student-to-\n     teacher ratio and access to related services within the classroom.\n\n  3. MEDICAL: Comprehensive medical evaluation is strongly recommended\n     to investigate the cause of the progressive developmental regression.\n     While this school psychologist is not qualified to make medical\n     diagnoses, the pattern observed is, in this evaluator's professional\n     opinion, atypical for ASD alone and warrants investigation for\n     possible neurological, metabolic, or genetic conditions that may be\n     contributing to or causing the regression.\n\n  4. RELATED SERVICES: Increase in speech-language therapy, occupational\n     therapy, and addition of physical therapy services recommended to\n     address declining motor function.\n\n  5. ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY: Formal assistive technology evaluation\n     recommended given declining communication and motor skills.\n\n  6. RE-EVALUATION: If medical evaluation reveals an underlying condition,\n     re-evaluation of educational classification and services should be\n     conducted promptly.\n\n_____________________________________\nTheresa Williams, Ph.D.\nLicensed School Psychologist\nOhio License #OH-PSY-2010-4817\nMaple Grove Elementary School\nFranklin County Educational Service Center\n\nDate: 03/26/2018\n\nCC: Student educational record\n    Denise Reeves (parent) \u2014 copy provided at IEP meeting\n    Dr. Patricia Huang, MD (per parent authorization) \u2014 faxed 04/02/2018\n\n\n================================================================================\n                     END OF MEDICAL RECORDS \u2014 SECTION 2\n                    PATIENT: ELI REEVES (DOB: 03/15/2012)\n                         AGES 4 YEARS \u2013 7 YEARS\n                    COVERING DATES: 05/2016 \u2013 03/2019\n\n  SECTION SUMMARY:\n  This section documents the critical period during which Eli Reeves\n  received 14 months of intensive ABA therapy with no progress and\n  progressive regression, was evaluated by a pediatrician who monitored\n  but deferred, and was seen by a neurologist who ordered MRI but not\n  EEG. Multiple providers (BCBA, school psychologist, school nurse)\n  raised concerns about possible seizure activity and atypical\n  regression. The ASD diagnosis was never questioned despite mounting\n  evidence of a progressive neurological process.\n\n  KEY MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS SECTION:\n  1. EEG was never ordered despite multiple providers observing and\n     documenting episodes consistent with absence seizures\n  2. Neurologist accepted ASD diagnosis and attributed regression to\n     ASD natural history\n  3. MRI read as \"mildly prominent ventricles \u2014 likely normal variant\"\n     without comparison to age-3 MRI (not available at Ohio facility);\n     possible early cerebellar volume loss was not appreciated\n  4. No metabolic workup was ordered despite progressive multi-domain\n     regression\n  5. No genetic testing was considered\n  6. Pediatrician deferred to neurology; neurologist deferred further\n     workup pending \"worsening\" \u2014 creating a gap in which no one\n     pursued the underlying cause\n  7. Wait times for specialty care (3-6 months for neurology) resulted\n     in significant delays during a period of rapid decline\n\n  TOTAL RECORDS IN SECTION 2: 20 documents from 4 providers + school\n

7-year-old mixed-race male referred by Dr. Patricia Huang (Pediatrics)\nfor evaluation of progressive gait abnormality and concern for developing\nscoliosis. Per mother, Danielle Reeves, Eli was diagnosed with autism spectrum\ndisorder at age 3 and has had progressive motor difficulties over the past\n2\u20133 years. She reports he was walking independently by 15 months but began\nstumbling frequently around age 5. Falls have increased to 3\u20134 times daily.\nHe now requires assistance on stairs and uneven surfaces. Mother states she\nhas noticed his spine appears \"curved\" when bathing him, which prompted the\nreferral.\n\nMother reports Eli has also had worsening speech, now limited to short 2\u20133\nword phrases, and episodes of \"staring\" that occur 2\u20133 times per day lasting\n10\u201320 seconds.

Physical therapy referral \u2014 Nationwide Children's Outpatient Rehab for\n   gait training, balance, and core strengthening. Recommend 2x/week.\n4. *** I am noting concern regarding the PROGRESSIVE nature of this child's\n   motor difficulties. The neurological examination findings (dysmetria,\n   ataxia, brisk reflexes, equivocal plantar responses) are NOT consistent\n   with a static encephalopathy or typical ASD motor features. I would\n   strongly recommend re-evaluation by Pediatric Neurology to rule out\n   a progressive neurological condition.

She\nstates Eli has been wearing them approximately 6 hours/day during school. She\nnotes the AFOs have helped with ankle stability but that his overall balance\ncontinues to worsen. He now requires hand-holding to walk on any uneven\nsurface. Falls have increased to 5\u20136 times daily despite the orthoses. He\nfell down 3 steps at school last month, sustaining a forehead contusion (seen\nat urgent care, no imaging obtained).\n\nMother also reports Eli has started physical therapy at Nationwide Children's\nOutpatient Rehab (therapist: Sarah Lindgren, DPT). She states the therapist\nhas expressed concern that Eli's presentation is \"not typical\" for ASD.\n\nSpeech has continued to decline \u2014 now primarily single words and gestures.\nStaring episodes continue 2\u20133 times daily. Mother has noticed Eli's body\n\"jerking\" during sleep several times per week.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n  Vitals:\n    Height:         120.8 cm (9th percentile)\n    Weight:          21.0 kg (7th percentile)\n    BMI:             14.4 (27th percentile)\n\n  General:    Thin male, wearing bilateral AFOs. Limited verbal output.\n              Said \"hi\" and \"mama\" during visit.\n\n  Spine:\n    - Forward bend: persistent right thoracic prominence, possibly increased\n    - Scoliometer: 10 degrees at T8\n\n  AFO Assessment:\n    - Bilateral articulating AFOs in good condition\n    - Appropriate fit, no skin breakdown\n    - Hindfoot alignment improved to neutral in orthoses\n\n  Gait (with AFOs):\n    - Remains wide-based\n    - Increased truncal sway compared to July visit\n    - Now intermittently reaching for walls/furniture for support\n    - Unable to perform tandem gait\n\n  Neurological (screening):\n    - Tone: increased bilateral LE, mild spasticity at ankles\n    - DTRs: 3+ bilateral LE\n    - Dysmetria: worsened \u2014 now overshooting on finger-to-nose by ~3 cm\n    - Intention tremor noted bilateral UE (NEW finding)\n\nIMAGING:\n  PA standing scoliosis radiograph:\n    - Right thoracic curve now measures 14 degrees (Cobb), apex T8\n    - Progression of 2 degrees over 3 months\n    - Risser: 0\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Juvenile scoliosis \u2014 progressed from 12 to 14 degrees over 3 months.\n   Still below bracing threshold but trajectory concerning given skeletal\n   immaturity.\n2. Progressive gait deterioration with worsening ataxia, NEW intention\n   tremor, and increasing spasticity \u2014 this is a PROGRESSIVE neurological\n   process. I reiterate my concern from July that this is NOT consistent\n   with ASD alone.\n3. Nocturnal myoclonus per parent report \u2014 needs neurological evaluation.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Continue scoliosis monitoring \u2014 return in 5 months for repeat films.\n   If curve reaches 20 degrees, will initiate TLSO bracing.\n2. Continue bilateral AFOs. Mother reports good compliance. Added velcro\n   strap modification for easier donning.\n3. Continue PT \u2014 will communicate with Sarah Lindgren, DPT regarding\n   worsening function.\n4. *** URGENT: I am writing a formal addendum to my July recommendation\n   for Pediatric Neurology re-evaluation. The appearance of intention\n   tremor and progressive spasticity in a child with an existing ASD\n   diagnosis demands urgent neurological workup. I will send a direct\n   message to Dr. Huang requesting neurology referral. The scoliosis\n   itself may be neuromuscular in etiology rather than idiopathic. ***\n5. Mother tearful during visit. She states she has been researching her\n   son's symptoms online and is frightened by what she has found. I\n   validated her concerns and encouraged her to advocate for the neurology\n   referral.

It has been approximately\n5 months since last orthopedic visit. Mother reports SIGNIFICANT functional\ndecline since October. Eli now uses a posterior walker for distances greater\nthan 50 feet and is using a wheelchair for community mobility (school,\ngrocery store). He can still walk short distances indoors with the walker\nand AFOs, but falls are now daily events.\n\nMother reports she requested a neurology referral through Dr. Huang in\nNovember 2019 but was told the wait time for a new neurology appointment\nis 4\u20135 months. An appointment is scheduled for March 2021 with Dr. Amara\nOsei in Pediatric Neurology.\n\n*** NOTE: The neurology appointment was initially scheduled for June 2020 but\nwas delayed to March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and clinic\nshutdowns. Mother is extremely frustrated by this delay. ***\n\nSpeech has further declined \u2014 Eli now uses approximately 10\u201315 single words\nand relies primarily on a picture communication board. Staring episodes\ncontinue. Sleep jerking has increased to nightly per parent report.\n\nMother brought a letter from Eli's physical therapist, Sarah Lindgren, DPT,\ndated March 4, 2020, expressing concern about a progressive neurological\ncondition. This letter is scanned into the chart (see Provider 7, Record 7.4).\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n  Vitals:\n    Height:         122.1 cm (8th percentile \u2014 dropping)\n    Weight:          20.8 kg (6th percentile \u2014 dropping)\n    BMI:             14.0 (19th percentile)\n\n  General:    Thin male in posterior walker with bilateral AFOs. No verbal\n              output during visit. Communicated by pointing to pictures\n              on communication board.\n\n  Spine:\n    - Forward bend: definite right thoracic prominence, increased\n    - Scoliometer: 14 degrees at T8\n    - Truncal lean to right in standing\n\n  Gait (with walker and AFOs):\n    - Severely ataxic, wide-based\n    - Significant truncal sway even with walker support\n    - Scissoring pattern emerging at ankles\n    - Walks approximately 30 feet before fatiguing\n    - Cannot walk without assistive device\n\n  Upper Extremities:\n    - Marked intention tremor bilaterally\n    - Difficulty grasping small objects\n    - Cannot write name (previously could at age 6)\n\nIMAGING:\n  PA and lateral standing scoliosis radiographs (in walker):\n    - Right thoracic curve now measures 18 degrees (Cobb), apex T7-8\n    - Progression of 4 degrees over 5 months (6 degrees total since July)\n    - Mild rotation at apex\n    - Risser: 0\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Progressive scoliosis \u2014 now 18 degrees, approaching bracing threshold.\n   Rate of progression (6 degrees in 8 months) is RAPID for a prepubertal\n   child. I am now classifying this as SECONDARY SCOLIOSIS, likely\n   neuromuscular in etiology, rather than juvenile idiopathic. The pattern\n   of long C-curve without compensatory curve is consistent with\n   neuromuscular scoliosis.\n2. Severe progressive gait deterioration \u2014 this child has gone from\n   independent ambulation to walker-dependent in under 12 months. This\n   is NOT consistent with ASD. This is a progressive neurological disease.\n3. Progressive upper extremity dysfunction \u2014 intention tremor, loss of\n   fine motor skills.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Initiate TLSO bracing for scoliosis. Referral to orthotics for custom\n   TLSO. Curve approaching 20 degrees with rapid progression in a Risser 0\n   child \u2014 high risk for continued progression.\n2. Continue bilateral AFOs. Current pair showing wear \u2014 will need\n   replacement in 2\u20133 months.\n3. Continue PT for as long as functional gains or maintenance are possible.\n4. *** I am writing a FORMAL LETTER to Dr. Patricia Huang and the\n   Nationwide Children's Neurology department requesting EXPEDITED\n   evaluation. This child has a clearly progressive neurodegenerative\n   condition that has been attributed to ASD for over 4 years. The rate\n   of motor decline is alarming. Every month of delay in diagnosis is a\n   month of lost opportunity for potential treatment.\n\n   I have discussed with mother the possibility of seeking a second\n   opinion at Cincinnati Children's or Cleveland Clinic if the local\n   neurology appointment cannot be moved up.

Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (age 3). Progressive\ngait abnormality and developing scoliosis. Recently fitted for bilateral\narticulating AFOs (pending fabrication). Dr. Okafor's referral notes concern\nfor neurological process beyond ASD.\n\nPARENT INTERVIEW:\nMother, Danielle Reeves, accompanied patient. She reports Eli walked\nindependently at 15 months. Gait was \"always a little clumsy\" but began\nnoticeably worsening around age 5. Over the past year, falls have increased\nfrom occasional to 3\u20134 times daily. He can no longer run. He needs\nhand-holding on stairs. He has difficulty getting up from the floor (uses\nfurniture to pull up). Mother is concerned his motor skills are going\n\"backwards\" \u2014 she states he could ride a tricycle at age 4 but can no longer\ndo so. He used to be able to kick a ball but now cannot balance on one foot\nat all.\n\nMother also reports speech regression (from sentences to short phrases),\nstaring episodes (2\u20133/day), and hand tremor when reaching for objects.\n\nPRIOR THERAPY HISTORY:\n  - Early Intervention PT (ages 18 months\u20133 years) \u2014 discharged\n  - School-based OT (current, 1x/week, 30 min)\n  - School-based speech therapy (current, 2x/week, 30 min)\n  - No prior outpatient PT\n\nSTANDARDIZED TESTING:\n\n  Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88):\n    Dimension A (Lying & Rolling):        92%\n    Dimension B (Sitting):                 84%\n    Dimension C (Crawling & Kneeling):     71%\n    Dimension D (Standing):                56%\n    Dimension E (Walking, Running, Jump):  37%\n    \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n    TOTAL GMFM-88 SCORE:                  68%\n\n  GMFCS Level:                             Level II (walks with limitations)\n\n  Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS):           28/56\n    (Normal for age: >50; at risk for falls: <40)\n\n  Timed Up and Go (TUG):                  18.4 seconds\n    (Normal for age 7: 5\u20136 seconds; SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED)\n\n  6-Minute Walk Test:                      142 meters\n    (Normal for age 7: ~470\u2013550 meters; 26% of expected)\n\nCLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:\n\n  Posture (standing):\n    - Wide base of support (~18 inches between heels)\n    - Mild right thoracic scoliotic curve visible\n    - Forward head posture\n    - Bilateral genu recurvatum\n    - Bilateral hindfoot valgus (corrected in AFOs \u2014 not yet received)\n\n  Gait Analysis (without AFOs):\n    - Cadence: 82 steps/min (normal ~130 for age)\n    - Step length: shortened bilaterally, asymmetric (L < R)\n    - Wide-based, lurching quality\n    - Truncal sway \u2014 lateral excursion ~6 cm (excessive)\n    - Absent heel strike bilaterally \u2014 flat foot contact\n    - No reciprocal arm swing\n    - Frequent loss of balance requiring recovery steps\n    - Unable to walk >100 feet without rest break\n\n  Balance:\n    - Single-leg stance: R = 1.2 sec, L = 0.8 sec (norm >10 sec at age 7)\n    - Tandem stance: unable to maintain >2 seconds\n    - Tandem gait: unable \u2014 immediately steps out of line\n    - Romberg: positive \u2014 marked posterior sway with eyes closed\n\n  Coordination:\n    - Finger-to-nose: dysmetric bilaterally, overshooting target\n    - Rapid alternating movements (forearm pronation/supination): slow,\n      irregular, dysdiadochokinetic\n    - Heel-to-shin: unable to track smoothly, jerky trajectory\n\n  Tone & Reflexes:\n    - Mildly increased tone bilateral LE (Modified Ashworth 1)\n    - Patellar DTRs: brisk (3+)\n    - Ankle clonus: 2\u20133 beats bilaterally (unsustained)\n\n  Functional Mobility:\n    - Floor to stand: requires furniture support, Gowers-like pattern\n    - Stair ascent: step-to pattern with bilateral rail, requires verbal\n      cuing and intermittent physical assist\n    - Stair descent: step-to pattern, max assist for safety\n    - Seated balance: fair \u2014 can maintain but sways with perturbation\n\nCLINICAL IMPRESSION:\nThis is a 7-year-old male presenting with a movement pattern that includes\nsignificant cerebellar signs (ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia,\nintention tremor, wide-based gait) AND upper motor neuron signs (brisk\nreflexes, ankle clonus, mildly increased tone).

Wheelchair (Zippie\nmanual, tilt-in-space) obtained in January 2020 through insurance and is\nused for school and community mobility. Mother reports he can walk about\n20\u201330 feet with the walker before fatiguing. He requires moderate assist\nfor all transfers.\n\nSpeech is now limited to approximately 10 single words. Staring spells\nnow occur 3\u20134 times daily. Mother reports one episode where Eli's entire\nbody stiffened for approximately 20 seconds followed by confusion \u2014 this\noccurred at school and the nurse called 911.

All standardized measures show accelerating regression. He\nhas transitioned from GMFCS Level II to Level III. At the current rate of\ndecline, he will likely be non-ambulatory within 6\u201312 months.\n\nI am now formally documenting my professional opinion that this child's\nmotor presentation is NOT CONSISTENT WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER and\nthat a progressive neurodegenerative condition must be ruled out.

I have now seen Eli for 36 sessions over approximately\n7 months, and I am compelled to formally document my observations and\nprofessional concerns.\n\nSUMMARY OF MOTOR DECLINE:\nSince initiating physical therapy, Eli has demonstrated CONTINUOUS AND\nACCELERATING motor regression despite consistent, intensive intervention\n(2x/week, 45-minute sessions, 94% attendance rate). His standardized\nassessment scores are as follows:\n\n  GMFM-88 Total Score:\n    August 2019 (Initial):     68%\n    November 2019 (3 months):  64%  (decline of 4%)\n    February 2020 (6 months):  58%  (decline of 10% total)\n\n  GMFCS Level:\n    August 2019:               Level II (walks with limitations)\n    February 2020:             Level III (walks with handheld device)\n\n  Pediatric Balance Scale:\n    August 2019:               28/56\n    February 2020:             18/56\n\n  6-Minute Walk Test:\n    August 2019:               142 meters\n    February 2020:              64 meters (55% decline)\n\n  Timed Up and Go:\n    August 2019:               18.4 seconds\n    February 2020:             34.7 seconds (89% slower)\n\n  Equipment Progression:\n    August 2019:               Independent ambulation (with falls)\n    September 2019:            Bilateral AFOs prescribed\n    November 2019:             Posterior walker introduced\n    January 2020:              Wheelchair obtained\n\nTHIS PATTERN OF DECLINE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER.\n\nIn my 14 years of clinical practice in pediatric neurological rehabilitation,\nI have treated hundreds of children with ASD. Children with ASD may have\nmotor clumsiness, hypotonia, motor planning difficulties, and coordination\ndeficits. However, these features are STATIC or SLOWLY IMPROVING with\nintervention \u2014 they do NOT progressively worsen. The motor profile I am\nobserving in Eli is characteristic of a PROGRESSIVE NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION,\nspecifically one affecting cerebellar and upper motor neuron pathways.\n\nSPECIFIC CLINICAL FINDINGS INCONSISTENT WITH ASD:\n\n1. CEREBELLAR SIGNS: Eli demonstrates a textbook cerebellar syndrome\n   including progressive ataxia (truncal and appendicular), dysmetria,\n   dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, and what appears to be nystagmus.\n   These findings are NOT features of ASD. They are features of cerebellar\n   degeneration.\n\n2. UPPER MOTOR NEURON SIGNS: Eli has brisk deep tendon reflexes (3+),\n   ankle clonus (now 4\u20135 beats), and mildly increased tone in the lower\n   extremities. These suggest corticospinal tract involvement. ASD does\n   not cause upper motor neuron signs.\n\n3. MYOCLONUS: I have directly observed myoclonic jerks during therapy\n   sessions, increasing in frequency from 3 per session in November to\n   5 per session in February. Mother reports nightly myoclonic jerks\n   during sleep. This suggests a seizure disorder or progressive\n   myoclonic condition.\n\n4. REGRESSION: Eli is LOSING previously acquired motor skills. He could\n   ride a tricycle at age 4 and cannot now. He could write his name at\n   age 6 and cannot now. He was walking independently at age 7 and now\n   requires a walker. Children with ASD do not lose gross motor milestones\n   in this pattern.\n\n5. SPEECH REGRESSION: Although speech is outside my primary scope, I note\n   that Eli's verbal output has declined from short sentences to\n   approximately 10 single words, with emerging dysarthria. Speech\n   regression in a child over age 3 should prompt investigation for\n   neurological disease.\n\n6. NEW BULBAR SIGNS: Mother reports coughing with thin liquids and I have\n   observed intermittent drooling \u2014 these suggest emerging dysphagia and\n   are NOT features of ASD.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS (for the treating physicians):\nWhile diagnosis is outside my scope of practice, the combination of\nprogressive cerebellar ataxia, upper motor neuron signs, myoclonus, speech\nregression, and possible seizures in a school-age child is a recognizable\nclinical pattern. I would respectfully suggest that the following conditions\nbe considered in the neurological workup:\n  - Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)\n  - Juvenile-onset leukodystrophy\n  - Mitochondrial disease\n  - Ataxia-telangiectasia\n  - Wilson disease\n  - Progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndrome\n\nREQUEST:\nI am formally requesting that Eli's upcoming neurology appointment (currently\nscheduled for March 2021 \u2014 ONE FULL YEAR from now) be EXPEDITED to the\nearliest possible date. This child is deteriorating rapidly. Based on the\ntrajectory of his decline, he will likely be non-ambulatory within 6 months\nand may require gastrostomy tube feeding if dysphagia progresses.\n\nI am also requesting that this letter be placed in Eli's medical record and\nthat I receive confirmation of receipt from all addressees.\n\nI remain available to discuss my findings with any member of Eli's care team\nat any time.

He was recently\ndiagnosed with a progressive neurodegenerative condition (neuronal ceroid\nlipofuscinosis \u2014 see Neurology records, Dr. Osei) which confirms the\nconcerns I have documented throughout his course of treatment.\n\nSUMMARY OF TREATMENT COURSE:\n  Duration:           August 2019 \u2014 September 2021 (25 months)\n  Sessions attended:  87 of 94 scheduled (93% attendance)\n  COVID interruption: March 2020 \u2014 June 2020 (telehealth only, limited)\n                      In-person resumed July 2020\n\nFUNCTIONAL TRAJECTORY (GMFM-88 scores):\n  August 2019:        68%  | GMFCS Level II\n  November 2019:      64%  | GMFCS Level II\u2013III\n  February 2020:      58%  | GMFCS Level III\n  July 2020:          48%  | GMFCS Level III\u2013IV  (post-COVID gap)\n  January 2021:       38%  | GMFCS Level IV\n  September 2021:     22%  | GMFCS Level IV\u2013V\n\nCURRENT FUNCTIONAL STATUS AT DISCHARGE:\n  - Non-ambulatory \u2014 full-time wheelchair user (tilt-in-space manual chair)\n  - Requires moderate-maximum assist for all transfers\n  - Sitting balance: poor \u2014 requires lateral trunk supports in wheelchair\n  - Unable to maintain floor sitting without support\n  - Upper extremity function: severely impaired by intention tremor and\n    myoclonus \u2014 unable to self-feed, requires full assist for ADLs\n  - Verbal output: <5 words, severely dysarthric\n  - Using eye-gaze AAC device (obtained June 2021)\n  - G-tube placed August 2021 due to progressive dysphagia\n  - Seizures: generalized tonic-clonic 2\u20133x/month, myoclonic daily\n    (on medication \u2014 levetiracetam and clobazam)\n\nEQUIPMENT IN PLACE AT DISCHARGE:\n  - Zippie tilt-in-space manual wheelchair with custom seating\n  - Bilateral AFOs (for positioning, no longer for ambulation)\n  - TLSO brace (scoliosis now 34 degrees per last orthopedic visit)\n  - Stander (EasyStand Bantam, for weight-bearing 30 min/day)\n  - Hospital bed with side rails\n  - Hoyer lift (obtained September 2021)\n  - Eye-gaze AAC device (Tobii Dynavox I-15)\n\nTHERAPIST FINAL COMMENTS:\nI have treated Eli Reeves for over two years. During that time, I watched\na child who walked into my clinic under his own power become wheelchair-\ndependent and nearly fully reliant on caregivers for all activities of\ndaily living. I documented my concerns about a progressive neurological\ncondition in August 2019, reiterated them in November 2019, formalized\nthem in a letter in March 2020, and they were ultimately confirmed by\nDr. Osei's diagnosis in mid-2021.\n\nI want to note for the record that the diagnosis of ASD \u2014 while possibly\na comorbid condition \u2014 functioned as a \"diagnostic overshadowing\" that\ndelayed recognition of Eli's progressive neurological disease by years.\nThe signs were present and worsening throughout his time in my care.\nMultiple providers, including Dr. Okafor and myself, documented concern\nand requested expedited neurology evaluation. Systemic delays (wait times,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic) contributed to the diagnostic delay.\n\nI wish Eli and his family the very best. He is a sweet child who tried\nhis hardest in every session. His mother is a fierce advocate who never\nstopped searching for answers.\n\nHOME-BASED PT RECOMMENDATIONS:\n  - PT 2x/week in home for positioning, ROM, caregiver training\n  - Focus: contracture prevention, skin integrity, respiratory function\n  - Standing program: 30 min/day in stander for bone health\n  - Stretching: hamstrings, hip flexors, ankle plantarflexors \u2014 2x/day\n  - Respiratory: assisted coughing techniques, incentive spirometry if able\n\nREFERRAL: Home Health PT ordered through Medicaid waiver program.\nContact: Franklin County Board of DD \u2014 (614) 475-6440\n\nElectronically signed by:\nSarah Lindgren, DPT, PCS\nDate: 09/13/2021 18:02 EST\n\nCC: Michael Okafor, MD; Patricia Huang, MD; Amara Osei, MD\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\n[PROVIDER 8 OF 11]\n\nPHYSICIAN:        Amara Osei, MD, PhD\nSPECIALTY:        Pediatric Neurology \u2014 Neurogenetics &\n                  Neurodegenerative Diseases\nPRACTICE:         Nationwide Children's Hospital \u2014 Department of Neurology\nADDRESS:          700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205\nPHONE:            (614) 722-4625\nFAX:              (614) 722-4626\nNPI:              1356782410\nTAX ID:           31-4379862\n\nPATIENT MRN:      NCH-2019-77432\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nRECORD 8.1 \u2014 PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY CONSULTATION\nDate of Service:    March 8, 2021\nPatient Age:        9 years, 0 months\nVisit Type:         New Patient Neurology Consultation\nReferring Provider: Patricia Huang, MD (Pediatrics)\nAdditional referral: Michael Okafor, MD (Orthopedics)\n                     Sarah Lindgren, DPT (Physical Therapy)\nICD-10:             R26.0 (Ataxic gait)\n                    R27.0 (Ataxia, unspecified)\n                    G25.3 (Myoclonus)\n                    R47.1 (Dysarthria)\n                    F84.0 (Autism spectrum disorder)\n                    R56.9 (Unspecified convulsions \u2014 to evaluate)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n                    NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL\n                    Department of Neurology\n                    Neurogenetics & Neurodegenerative Disease Program\n\n                    *** NEW PATIENT CONSULTATION ***\n                    *** EXTENDED VISIT \u2014 90 MINUTES ***\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:\n9-year-old male with existing diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder referred\nfor evaluation of progressive motor regression, suspected seizures, and\nspeech regression. Multiple providers (orthopedics, physical therapy) have\ndocumented concern that the patient's clinical trajectory is inconsistent\nwith ASD and suggestive of a progressive neurological condition. Referral\ninitially placed November 2019; delayed by COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI have reviewed the following records prior to this visit:\n  - Dr. Patricia Huang (PCP) \u2014 records from 2015\u20132021\n  - Dr. Robert Yuen (Developmental Pediatrics) \u2014 ASD evaluation, 2015\n  - Dr. Michael Okafor (Orthopedics) \u2014 records from 2019\u20132020\n  - Sarah Lindgren, DPT (PT) \u2014 evaluation and progress notes 2019\u20132020,\n    INCLUDING her formal letter of concern dated March 4, 2020\n  - Columbus Children's Academy \u2014 IEP documents, 2018\u20132020\n  - Nationwide Children's ED visit, January 22, 2020\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nEli is a 9-year-old mixed-race (Black/White) male who presents with his\nmother, Danielle Reeves, for evaluation of a progressive neurological\ndecline that has been ongoing for approximately 4\u20135 years.\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY (reviewed in detail with mother):\n  Prenatal:       Uncomplicated pregnancy, prenatal care initiated at 8 weeks\n  Birth:          Full term (39w2d), SVD, birth weight 7 lbs 4 oz, Apgar 8/9\n  Newborn:        Unremarkable nursery course, discharged day 2\n\n  Motor milestones:\n    Sat independently:   6 months (normal)\n    Crawled:             9 months (normal)\n    Pulled to stand:     11 months (normal)\n    Walked independently: 15 months (mildly delayed)\n    Ran:                  22 months (normal)\n    Rode tricycle:        age 4 (normal)\n\n  Language milestones:\n    Babbled:              8 months (normal)\n    First words:          14 months (normal)\n    2-word phrases:       24 months (normal)\n    Short sentences:      age 3 (normal for lower end)\n\n  *** KEY OBSERVATION: This child's early developmental trajectory was\n  essentially NORMAL through at least age 3. Motor milestones were\n  achieved on time or near-normal. Language milestones were achieved.\n  This is CRITICAL \u2014 a child with a neurodegenerative disease may have\n  a period of normal development before the onset of regression. ***\n\nTIMELINE OF REGRESSION (constructed from parent report and medical records):\n  Age 3 (2015):    ASD diagnosed. Concerns at this time were primarily\n                    behavioral (limited eye contact, restricted interests,\n                    repetitive behaviors). Motor exam was reportedly normal\n                    aside from \"mild clumsiness.\"\n\n  Age 4\u20135 (2016\u20132017): Mother began noticing increasing clumsiness.\n                    Falls became more frequent. Speech plateaued, then\n                    began to shorten. Teachers noted difficulty with\n                    previously mastered tasks (cutting with scissors,\n                    coloring within lines).\n\n  Age 5\u20136 (2017\u20132018): Falls 2\u20133 times daily. Unable to ride tricycle\n                    (previously could). Handwriting deteriorating.\n                    Staring episodes began \u2014 initially attributed to\n                    \"ASD zoning out.\"\n\n  Age 6\u20137 (2018\u20132019): Falls 3\u20134 times daily. Speech reduced to short\n                    phrases. Staring episodes 2\u20133/day. Sleep myoclonus\n                    began. Mother describes hand tremor when reaching.\n\n  Age 7\u20138 (2019\u20132020): AFOs prescribed. Posterior walker. Wheelchair\n                    obtained. GMFM declined 68%\u219258%. PT documents\n                    cerebellar signs, UMN signs, myoclonus. PT writes\n                    formal letter of concern (March 2020).\n\n  Age 8\u20139 (2020\u20132021): Became non-ambulatory. Speech declined to ~5\n                    words. G-tube placed for progressive dysphagia.\n                    Seizure activity increasing (mother describes\n                    2\u20133 episodes per month of whole-body stiffening\n                    followed by jerking, lasting 1\u20133 minutes).\n\nFAMILY HISTORY (three-generation pedigree obtained):\n  Mother (Danielle Reeves, age 35): healthy, African American\n  Father (Marcus Reeves, age 37): healthy, Caucasian\n  No siblings\n  Maternal grandmother: type 2 diabetes, hypertension \u2014 alive, age 62\n  Maternal grandfather: deceased age 58, MI\n  Paternal grandmother: alive, age 65, healthy\n  Paternal grandfather: alive, age 68, mild cognitive decline (dementia?)\n  No known family history of:\n    - Childhood neurological disease\n    - Seizure disorders\n    - Developmental regression\n    - Consanguinity\n    - Early childhood death\n\n  *** Note: NCL can be autosomal recessive.

No verbal greeting. Eyes open, appears to track\n           examiner briefly. Intermittent myoclonic jerks of bilateral\n           upper extremities observed during the examination (counted\n           7 episodes in 90 minutes). Mother assists with all positioning.\n\n  HEENT:\n    - Head: normocephalic, atraumatic\n    - Eyes: Fundoscopic exam \u2014 *** BILATERAL MACULAR CHANGES noted.\n      There is a subtle but definite orange-brown discoloration of the\n      maculae bilaterally with surrounding retinal pallor. This is\n      suggestive of lipofuscin accumulation and is concerning for\n      neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

He became cyanotic\naround the lips. Post-ictally, he was unresponsive for approximately\n4 minutes, then gradually returned to his baseline. SpO2 nadir: 89%.\nMother states this is typical of his seizures and occurs 2\u20133 times per\nmonth. No rescue medication was administered as the seizure self-resolved\nwithin 2 minutes.\n\n*** THIS IS AN UNPROVOKED GENERALIZED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE WITNESSED\nBY A PHYSICIAN. This child has an active seizure disorder that has\nNEVER BEEN EVALUATED with EEG. ***\n\nCLINICAL IMPRESSION:\n\nThis is a 9-year-old male with a PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE\nthat has been misattributed to autism spectrum disorder for approximately\n6 years. I want to state clearly and unequivocally:\n\n*** THIS CHILD'S CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS NOT AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. ***\n\nWhile Eli may have had some features consistent with ASD (restricted\ninterests, repetitive behaviors) in early childhood \u2014 and ASD may be a\ncomorbid condition \u2014 the DOMINANT clinical picture is one of a progressive\nneurodegenerative disease characterized by:\n  1. Progressive cerebellar ataxia (truncal and appendicular)\n  2. Progressive spasticity (upper motor neuron involvement)\n  3. Progressive cognitive decline (dementia)\n  4. Progressive speech loss (aphasia and dysarthria)\n  5. Seizures (generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic)\n  6. Progressive dysphagia\n  7. Macular changes on fundoscopy\n  8. Visual decline\n\nThis constellation \u2014 particularly the combination of progressive dementia,\nseizures, motor regression, myoclonus, and MACULAR CHANGES \u2014 is highly\nsuggestive of NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS (Batten disease), most likely\nthe late-infantile or juvenile form (CLN2 or CLN3).\n\nThe macular changes I observed on fundoscopy today are characteristic of\nlipofuscin accumulation in retinal neurons and are a hallmark of NCL.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:\n  1. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 or CLN3) \u2014 HIGHEST SUSPICION\n  2. Juvenile-onset GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs variant)\n  3. Mitochondrial disease (MERRF, MELAS)\n  4. Niemann-Pick type C\n  5. Wilson disease (less likely given age of onset)\n  6. Juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy\n\nPLAN:\n  1. URGENT EEG \u2014 24-hour ambulatory EEG with video monitoring. Scheduled\n     for April 5\u20136, 2021. Expecting to see generalized spike-and-wave\n     discharges, possible photoparoxysmal response, background slowing.\n  2. URGENT MRI Brain with and without contrast \u2014 with specific attention\n     to cerebellar volume, white matter signal, cortical atrophy.\n     Comparison with any prior imaging. Scheduled April 7, 2021.\n  3. Laboratory workup:\n     - CBC, CMP, hepatic function panel\n     - Lactate, pyruvate (mitochondrial screen)\n     - Ceruloplasmin, serum copper (Wilson disease screen)\n     - Urine organic acids\n     - Plasma amino acids\n     - Lysosomal enzyme panel (including TPP1/CLN2 enzyme activity)\n     - Acylcarnitine profile\n     - Very long chain fatty acids\n  4. Ophthalmology referral \u2014 URGENT \u2014 for formal retinal examination,\n     OCT, electroretinography (ERG).\n  5. Genetics referral \u2014 for genetic counseling and anticipated genetic\n     testing (NCL gene panel or whole exome sequencing).\n  6. Initiate anti-seizure medication: LEVETIRACETAM (Keppra) 250 mg\n     PO BID, titrate to 500 mg BID over 2 weeks. Mother educated on\n     medication, side effects, and seizure action plan.\n  7. Follow-up in my clinic after EEG and MRI results are available \u2014\n     tentatively scheduled June 2021.\n  8. Mother is understandably distressed. She has been telling providers\n     for years that \"something more is going on.\" She is correct. I spent\n     30 minutes counseling her on what we are investigating, what the\n     possible diagnoses mean, and what the next steps are. I provided her\n     with written information about NCL and the Batten Disease Support\n     and Research Association (BDSRA) website. Social work consult placed.\n\nTime spent: 90 minutes face-to-face, 45 minutes chart review and\ndocumentation. Total: 135 minutes. >50% counseling and coordination.\n\nElectronically signed by:\nAmara Osei, MD, PhD\nPediatric Neurology \u2014 Neurogenetics\nNationwide Children's Hospital\nDate: 03/08/2021 20:15 EST\n\nCC: Patricia Huang, MD; Michael Okafor, MD; Sarah Lindgren, DPT\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nRECORD 8.2 \u2014 EEG REPORT\nDate of Service:    April 5\u20136, 2021\nPatient Age:        9 years, 0 months\nStudy Type:         24-Hour Continuous Video EEG Monitoring\nOrdering Physician: Amara Osei, MD\nInterpreting:       Amara Osei, MD, PhD & James Whitfield, MD (EEG Fellow)\nICD-10:             G40.309 (Generalized epilepsy, not intractable)\n                    R56.9 (Unspecified convulsions)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n              NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL\n              Department of Neurology\n              Neurodiagnostic Laboratory \u2014 EEG\n\n              ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY REPORT\n\nCLINICAL INDICATION:\nProgressive neurodevelopmental regression with witnessed generalized\ntonic-clonic seizures and myoclonus.

MARKEDLY ABNORMAL 24-HOUR VIDEO EEG.\n\n2. Severe diffuse background slowing (5\u20136 Hz) consistent with moderate-\n   to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction / encephalopathy. This degree\n   of slowing in a 9-year-old is highly abnormal.\n\n3. Multiple seizure types captured: absence, myoclonic, and generalized\n   tonic-clonic \u2014 indicating a GENERALIZED EPILEPSY SYNDROME.\n\n4. Multifocal epileptiform discharges indicating widespread cortical\n   hyperexcitability.\n\n5. Robust photoparoxysmal response \u2014 characteristic of progressive\n   myoclonic epilepsy / neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.\n\n6. Near-continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ESES pattern) \u2014\n   likely contributing to progressive cognitive decline.\n\n7. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The combination of progressive dementia,\n   multiple seizure types (including myoclonic and absence), background\n   slowing, photoparoxysmal response, and ESES pattern is HIGHLY\n   CONSISTENT with a progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndrome, most\n   likely NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS given the clinical context.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n  - Optimize anti-seizure medication \u2014 current levetiracetam dose is\n    subtherapeutic. Recommend uptitration and consideration of adding\n    clobazam for myoclonic seizures.\n  - AVOID valproic acid until mitochondrial disease is excluded.\n  - AVOID carbamazepine/phenytoin \u2014 may worsen myoclonic seizures.\n  - Repeat EEG in 3\u20136 months to assess treatment response and\n    disease progression.\n\nElectronically signed by:\nAmara Osei, MD, PhD \u2014 Attending Physician\nJames Whitfield, MD \u2014 EEG Fellow\nNationwide Children's Hospital \u2014 Neurodiagnostic Laboratory\nDate: 04/08/2021 11:30 EST\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nRECORD 8.3 \u2014 MRI BRAIN REPORT\nDate of Service:    April 7, 2021\nPatient Age:        9 years, 0 months\nStudy Type:         MRI Brain with and without Gadolinium Contrast\nOrdering Physician: Amara Osei, MD\nInterpreting:       Rachel Zimmerman, MD (Pediatric Neuroradiology)\nICD-10:             G31.9 (Degenerative disease of nervous system, unspec)\n                    G40.309 (Generalized epilepsy)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n              NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL\n              Department of Radiology\n              Section of Pediatric Neuroradiology\n\n              MRI BRAIN \u2014 DIAGNOSTIC REPORT\n\nCLINICAL INDICATION:\nProgressive neurodegenerative condition with seizures, motor regression,\ncognitive decline.

Temporal horns mildly prominent.\n    - No mesial temporal sclerosis.\n\n  Post-Contrast:\n    - No abnormal parenchymal enhancement.\n    - No leptomeningeal enhancement.\n    - No mass lesion.\n\n  MR Spectroscopy:\n    Cerebellar vermis:\n      - Decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak \u2014 indicating neuronal\n        loss/dysfunction\n      - Elevated myoinositol (mI) \u2014 indicating gliosis\n      - NAA/Cr ratio: 1.1 (normal >1.6 for age) \u2014 MARKEDLY REDUCED\n      - Choline/Cr ratio: mildly elevated \u2014 suggesting membrane turnover\n      - No lactate peak identified in this voxel\n\n    Left basal ganglia:\n      - Mildly decreased NAA\n      - NAA/Cr ratio: 1.4 (low-normal)\n      - Small lactate doublet detected at 1.3 ppm \u2014 *** ABNORMAL,\n        suggesting impaired mitochondrial function ***\n\n  Other:\n    - Orbits: optic nerves appear mildly thin bilaterally (volume loss)\n    - No extra-axial collection\n    - Calvarium: normal\n    - Paranasal sinuses: mild mucosal thickening in maxillary sinuses\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. MARKEDLY ABNORMAL MRI demonstrating a pattern of PROGRESSIVE\n   NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE in a 9-year-old male.\n\n2. SEVERE CEREBELLAR ATROPHY \u2014 disproportionate to cerebral atrophy,\n   with estimated 35% volume loss. Cerebellar cortex shows signal\n   change suggesting active degeneration. This correlates with the\n   patient's progressive ataxia.\n\n3. DIFFUSE CEREBRAL CORTICAL ATROPHY with occipital-parietal predominance.\n   Cortical thinning is most severe in the visual cortex, correlating\n   with the patient's visual decline.\n\n4. DIFFUSE WHITE MATTER SIGNAL ABNORMALITY \u2014 periventricular and posterior\n   predominant, consistent with demyelination/gliosis.\n\n5. Ex vacuo ventriculomegaly secondary to parenchymal volume loss.\n\n6. Thalamic signal change (pulvinar regions) \u2014 can be associated with\n   neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.\n\n7. MR spectroscopy: Decreased NAA in cerebellum (neuronal loss), elevated\n   myoinositol (gliosis), and small lactate peak in basal ganglia\n   (possible mitochondrial dysfunction).\n\n8. OVERALL PATTERN: The combination of progressive cerebellar atrophy,\n   cortical atrophy (occipital predominant), white matter changes, and\n   thalamic signal abnormality is CONSISTENT WITH NEURONAL CEROID\n   LIPOFUSCINOSIS. The cerebellar predominance of the atrophy may\n   suggest CLN2 (late-infantile) form, though overlap between subtypes\n   exists.\n\n9. Given the absence of prior imaging, it is not possible to document\n   the rate of progression radiographically. Recommend follow-up MRI\n   in 12 months for comparison.\n\nElectronically signed by:\nRachel Zimmerman, MD\nPediatric Neuroradiology\nNationwide Children's Hospital\nDate: 04/09/2021 09:45

EEG: I explained that Eli's EEG showed multiple types of seizures\n     (11 in 24 hours), severe background slowing indicating widespread\n     brain dysfunction, and a photoparoxysmal response that is\n     characteristic of NCL. His staring episodes are absence seizures.\n     His sleep jerking consists of myoclonic seizures. The episodes of\n     body stiffening and jerking are generalized tonic-clonic seizures.\n\n  2. MRI: I showed both parents the MRI images on my screen. I pointed\n     out the severe cerebellar atrophy (35% volume loss) and the diffuse\n     cortical atrophy. I compared Eli's scan to a normal 9-year-old\n     brain image. Mother gasped. Father was silent.\n\n  3. Labs: I explained that the TPP1 enzyme level of 0.8 (normal >5.0)\n     confirms that Eli's body cannot produce sufficient amounts of the\n     enzyme needed to break down certain cellular waste products\n     (lipofuscins). These waste products accumulate in neurons, causing\n     progressive neuronal death.\n\n  4. Prognosis: This was the most difficult part of the conversation.\n     I explained that CLN2 disease is a progressive, currently\n     incurable condition. Typical life expectancy with CLN2 disease\n     is 6\u201315 years from symptom onset, though some patients survive\n     into their teens or early twenties with supportive care. I\n     explained that Eli's symptoms likely began around age 4\u20135, which\n     means he has been living with active disease for approximately\n     4\u20135 years.\n\n     I discussed the expected trajectory:\n       - Continued loss of motor function \u2192 becoming fully dependent\n       - Continued cognitive decline\n       - Seizures may become more difficult to control\n       - Progressive visual loss \u2192 likely blindness\n       - Progressive dysphagia (G-tube already in place)\n       - Respiratory complications in later stages\n\n     Mother was crying. Father stood and left the room for several\n     minutes. Social worker followed him. When he returned, he asked:\n     \"How did no one catch this sooner?\"\n\n  5. Treatment Options: I discussed the following:\n     a) CERLIPONASE ALFA (Brineura) \u2014 FDA-approved enzyme replacement\n        therapy for CLN2 disease, administered via intracerebroventricular\n        infusion every 2 weeks. I explained that this treatment has been\n        shown to slow the rate of motor and language decline in children\n        treated EARLY in the disease course. However, I was honest with\n        the family that Eli's disease is ADVANCED, and the benefit of\n        initiating ERT at this stage is uncertain. I recommended\n        referral to a CLN2 treatment center for evaluation.\n\n     b) Ongoing seizure management with optimization of anti-seizure\n        medications.\n\n     c) Supportive/palliative care to maximize quality of life.\n\n     d) Genetic testing of both parents (carrier testing) and genetic\n        counseling for future family planning.\n\nMEDICATION CHANGES:\n  - Levetiracetam: increase to 500 mg PO BID (from 250 mg BID)\n  - ADD: Clobazam (Onfi) 5 mg PO BID for myoclonic seizures\n  - Continue melatonin 5 mg QHS\n  - ADD: Diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) 10 mg PRN for seizures >5 minutes\n    (emergency rescue medication). Mother and father trained on\n    administration. School nurse to be trained as well.\n\nREFERRALS:\n  1.

Possible comorbid ASD (historical diagnosis) \u2014 F84.0\n     *** Note: The original ASD diagnosis from age 3 may represent early\n     manifestations of CLN2 disease rather than true autism spectrum\n     disorder. The behavioral features that led to the ASD diagnosis\n     (restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, social withdrawal) can\n     be seen in the early stages of NCL as the brain begins to\n     degenerate. I am listing ASD as a \"possible comorbid\" condition\n     rather than removing it entirely, as I cannot retrospectively\n     determine whether true ASD was present in addition to CLN2. ***\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n  - Neurology: 3 months (September 2021)\n  - Sooner if seizures worsen or new symptoms develop\n  - Mother has my direct office number for urgent concerns\n\nA NOTE ON DIAGNOSTIC DELAY:\nFor the medical record, I want to document the following timeline:\n  - Age 3 (2015): ASD diagnosed. Motor exam \"mildly clumsy.\"\n  - Age 5 (2017): Mother raising concerns about worsening. Attributed\n    to ASD.\n  - Age 7 (2019): Orthopedic surgeon documents concern and recommends\n    neurology re-evaluation. PT documents progressive cerebellar signs.\n  - Age 7 (2019): Neurology referral placed (November 2019).\n  - Age 8 (2020): PT writes formal letter requesting expedited evaluation.\n    Appointment delayed by COVID-19 from June 2020 to March 2021.\n  - Age 9 (2021): First neurology evaluation. Diagnosis confirmed.\n\nThe total time from first documented provider concern to diagnosis\nwas approximately 20 months (July 2019 to April 2021).

No metabolic screening.\n    What should have occurred: A more comprehensive differential diagnosis\n    that included neurodegenerative conditions, particularly given the\n    report of \"mild clumsiness\" that was already present.\n\n  OPPORTUNITY 2 (Ages 4\u20135, 2016\u20132017):\n    What happened: Mother reported increasing clumsiness, falls, and\n    speech plateau. PCP attributed to ASD.\n    What was missed: The transition from \"clumsy\" to \"falling frequently\"\n    represents a RED FLAG for progressive disease. Loss of tricycle-riding\n    ability (a previously mastered skill) is REGRESSION, not ASD.\n    What should have occurred: Referral to pediatric neurology when motor\n    regression was first reported.\n\n  OPPORTUNITY 3 (Ages 5\u20136, 2017\u20132018):\n    What happened: Staring episodes began. Attributed to \"ASD zoning out.\"\n    What was missed: Staring episodes in a child with developmental\n    regression should be evaluated with EEG. Any child with new-onset\n    staring spells deserves seizure evaluation.\n    What should have occurred: EEG. If performed at this time, the\n    characteristic NCL EEG pattern would likely have been present and\n    could have led to diagnosis 3\u20134 years earlier.\n\n  OPPORTUNITY 4 (Age 7, July 2019):\n    What happened: Dr. Okafor (orthopedics) documented cerebellar signs,\n    ataxia, and concern for progressive neurological condition. Recommended\n    neurology re-evaluation.\n    What was missed: The referral process was slow. No urgent pathway.\n    What should have occurred: STAT neurology consultation. A child with\n    documented cerebellar signs and progressive motor decline should be\n    seen urgently, not placed on a 4\u20135 month waitlist.\n\n  OPPORTUNITY 5 (Age 7, January 2020):\n    What happened: Eli was seen in the Nationwide Children's ED after a\n    witnessed seizure at school. Diagnosed as \"seizure vs. behavioral\n    staring spell in child with ASD.\" Discharged without EEG.\n    What was missed: A witnessed tonic event in a child with progressive\n    neurological decline was DISMISSED as possibly behavioral because of\n    the ASD label. This is diagnostic overshadowing at its most dangerous.\n    What should have occurred: Emergent or urgent EEG. Neurology consult\n    from the ED. Admission for workup.\n\n  OPPORTUNITY 6 (Age 8, March\u2013June 2020):\n    What happened: PT wrote a detailed, evidence-based letter requesting\n    expedited neurology evaluation. COVID-19 pandemic delayed the\n    appointment from June 2020 to March 2021.\n    What was missed: Despite a compelling clinical case documented by\n    PT and orthopedics, the system failed to expedite care even before\n    COVID. The pandemic added 9 months to an already lengthy wait.\n    What should have occurred: Telehealth neurology evaluation during\n    COVID. Record review and remote assessment could have initiated the\n    diagnostic workup months earlier.\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\nIMPACT OF DIAGNOSTIC DELAY:\n\nCLN2 disease has an FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy (cerliponase\nalfa / Brineura), which was approved in April 2017. Clinical trials have\ndemonstrated that early initiation of treatment can significantly slow\nthe rate of motor and language decline. The treatment is most effective\nwhen started BEFORE significant neurological damage has occurred \u2014 ideally\nat the earliest signs of disease.\n\nHad Eli been diagnosed at age 5\u20136 (when motor regression was first\nevident), he could have been started on cerliponase alfa at a time when\nhe was still walking independently, still speaking in sentences, and\nstill had preserved cognitive function. By the time he was diagnosed at\nage 9, he was wheelchair-dependent, nearly nonverbal, cognitively\nseverely impaired, and had a G-tube. The window for maximum therapeutic\nbenefit had largely closed.\n\nThis does not mean treatment at age 9 is futile \u2014 the family has been\nreferred to a CLN2 treatment center for evaluation \u2014 but the potential\nfor preserved function is significantly diminished compared to what\nmight have been achieved with earlier diagnosis.\n\nThe estimated delay from recognizable symptoms to diagnosis: 5\u20136 years.\nThe estimated delay from first provider concern to diagnosis: 20 months.\nThe estimated delay attributable to COVID-19: 9 months.\nThe estimated delay attributable to diagnostic overshadowing by ASD: 4+ years.\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\nINDIVIDUALS WHO RAISED CONCERN (documented in this section):\n\n  1. Danielle Reeves (Mother) \u2014 raised concerns as early as age 4\u20135,\n     repeatedly, at every visit. Researched symptoms online. Was told\n     her son \"has autism\" and his difficulties were \"part of ASD.\"\n\n  2. Dr. Michael Okafor, MD (Orthopedics) \u2014 first physician to formally\n     document that Eli's presentation was \"NOT consistent with ASD\" and\n     recommend neurology re-evaluation (July 2019). Reiterated concern\n     at every subsequent visit. Wrote formal letter (March 2020).\n\n  3. Sarah Lindgren, DPT (Physical Therapy) \u2014 meticulously documented\n     progressive decline with standardized measures. Wrote the landmark\n     formal letter of concern (March 2020) detailing specific clinical\n     findings inconsistent with ASD, including a differential diagnosis\n     that CORRECTLY listed NCL as the first consideration. This letter\n     is a model of interprofessional advocacy.\n\n  4. Dr. Amara Osei, MD, PhD (Neurology) \u2014 upon first evaluation,\n     immediately recognized the neurodegenerative pattern, ordered\n     appropriate workup, and confirmed the diagnosis within 6 weeks.\n     Documented the phenomenon of diagnostic overshadowing in the record.\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\n  This concludes Section 3 of 6.\n\n  Section 4 will cover: Genetic confirmation, ophthalmology evaluation,\n  CLN2 treatment center evaluation, and palliative care initiation\n  (ages 9\u201310, 2021\u20132022).\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n              END OF SECTION 3\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n================================================================================\n                        MEDICAL RECORDS \u2014 SECTION 4 OF 5\n                        PATIENT: REEVES, ELI MARCUS\n                        DOB: 03/15/2012\n                        AGES COVERED: 10 YEARS \u2014 14 YEARS\n                        LOCATIONS: FAYETTEVILLE, NC / FORT LIBERTY\n                        DATE RANGE: JUNE 2022 \u2014 MARCH 2026\n================================================================================\n\nNOTE: This section covers the patient's care following a military PCS\n(Permanent Change of Station) to Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg),\nFayetteville, North Carolina.

Mother (Denise\nReeves) has a personal binder with additional records that were not included in\nthe transferred medical file. She offered to bring this to the visit but was\nadvised we would review it at a dedicated follow-up appointment due to time\nconstraints.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nEli is a 10-year-old mixed-race (Black/White) male presenting to establish\nprimary care following a military PCS from Fort Benning, GA to Fort Liberty,\nNC. Per transferred records and parental report, Eli carries diagnoses of:\n  1. Autism Spectrum Disorder (diagnosed age 3.5, Virginia)\n  2. Epilepsy, generalized (diagnosed age 9, Ohio/Georgia)\n  3. Progressive motor decline \u2014 wheelchair dependent since approximately\n     age 9.5\n  4. Developmental regression (ongoing)\n  5. Scoliosis, mild thoracolumbar (monitored)\n\nPer mother, Eli was a full-term infant who met early milestones on time. He\nbegan to show developmental concerns around age 18-24 months with delayed\nwalking (achieved at 26 months) and language plateau. He was diagnosed with\nautism spectrum disorder at age 3.5 by a developmental pediatrician in\nVirginia. Mother states she has always felt the diagnosis did not fully explain\nEli's presentation, particularly the LOSS of skills over time.\n\nEli's motor function has progressively declined: he walked independently until\napproximately age 7-8, then required AFOs, then a walker, and has been\nwheelchair-dependent since approximately age 9.5. His speech has regressed from\nshort sentences (age 4-5) to primarily single words. He was diagnosed with\nepilepsy at age 9 after an EEG showed abnormalities. He is currently on\nlevetiracetam (Keppra) 500mg BID. Mother reports seizures are not fully\ncontrolled \u2014 she observes 3-5 staring episodes daily, each lasting 5-15\nseconds, with brief post-event confusion. She also reports nocturnal events\n(jerking movements) occurring several times per week, which she monitors via\na baby monitor with camera.\n\nMother reports that a neurologist in Ohio/Georgia (Dr. Osei) recommended\ngenetic testing, but this was never completed before the family's PCS. Mother\nis very concerned about the ongoing decline and the incomplete workup.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n  - ASD (age 3.5)\n  - Epilepsy, generalized (age 9) \u2014 on levetiracetam\n  - Progressive motor decline (wheelchair dependent)\n  - Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis\n  - History of constipation (chronic, managed with MiraLAX)\n  - No surgical history\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n  1. Levetiracetam (Keppra) 500mg PO BID\n  2. Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX) 8.5g PO daily\n  3. Melatonin 3mg PO QHS PRN\n\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. No food allergies.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n  - Mother: Denise Reeves, age 34, healthy. No significant medical history.\n  - Father: Marcus Reeves, SGT, USA, age 36, healthy. History of migraines.\n  - Paternal grandmother: \"memory problems\" reportedly beginning in her 60s.\n    No formal diagnosis documented. Deceased at age 71.\n  - Maternal grandmother: Hypertension, type 2 diabetes. Living, age 62.\n  - No siblings.\n  - No known family history of seizures, autism, or neurodegenerative disease\n    (per available records; family history may be incomplete).\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nFamily recently relocated from Fort Benning, GA to Fort Liberty, NC. Father\nis active-duty Army (SGT, E-5), infantry. Mother is primary caregiver and is\nnot currently employed outside the home due to Eli's care needs. Eli is\nenrolled in Cumberland County Schools, exceptional children's program. He\nreceives home-based services including PT and OT. The family lives in on-post\nhousing. Mother reports adequate support from military family services but\nsignificant stress related to Eli's medical complexity and the disruption of\ncare caused by the move. This is the family's third PCS since Eli's birth\n(Virginia \u2192 Georgia \u2192 North Carolina).\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n  Constitutional: Poor weight gain. Fatigue noted. No fevers.\n  HEENT: Mother reports concern about vision \u2014 \"sometimes he doesn't seem to\n    see things.\" No hearing concerns. Chronic constipation.\n  Neurological: Seizures as described above. Progressive motor decline.\n    Regression in speech and fine motor skills. Tremor noted in hands.\n  Musculoskeletal: Wheelchair dependent. Mild scoliosis. Joint contractures\n    developing at ankles bilaterally.\n  Psychiatric/Behavioral: Sleep disturbance. Irritability (increasing).\n    Hand-wringing stereotypies (constant when awake).\n  All other systems reviewed and negative or as noted above.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n  Vitals:\n    Height: 53.2 inches (135.1 cm) \u2014 10th percentile for age\n    Weight: 62 lbs (28.1 kg) \u2014 8th percentile for age\n    BMI: 15.4 kg/m\u00b2 \u2014 18th percentile\n    HR: 88 bpm | BP: 98/62 mmHg | Temp: 98.4\u00b0F | SpO2: 98% RA\n    Head circumference: 52.8 cm (35th percentile)\n\n  General: Thin male appearing stated age, seated in wheelchair. Alert. Makes\n    brief eye contact. Minimal spontaneous verbalization.\n  HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light \u2014\n    but response appears sluggish bilaterally. Extraocular movements: difficulty\n    with smooth pursuit tracking. TMs clear bilaterally. Oropharynx clear.\n    Dentition fair \u2014 mild crowding.\n  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.\n  Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.\n  Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n  Abdomen: Soft, mildly distended (likely stool burden), non-tender. Bowel\n    sounds present. No organomegaly.\n  Musculoskeletal: Mild thoracolumbar scoliosis (convex right). Bilateral\n    ankle contractures (approximately 10 degrees from neutral). Decreased\n    muscle bulk throughout. Increased tone in lower extremities, decreased\n    tone in trunk.\n  Skin: No rashes or lesions. Skin intact under wheelchair straps.\n  Neurological:\n    - Mental status: Alert, responds to name. Minimal verbal output \u2014 said\n      \"mama\" once and \"no\" once during the visit. Follows simple one-step\n      commands inconsistently. Does not appear to understand complex\n      instructions.\n    - Cranial nerves: Difficult to formally assess. See pupillary response\n      above. Facial symmetry present. Gag intact.\n    - Motor: Wheelchair-bound. Unable to stand or bear weight. Upper\n      extremities: can reach for objects but grasp is weak and imprecise.\n      Significant cerebellar-type ataxia in upper extremities (intention\n      tremor, past-pointing). Constant hand-wringing stereotypies when not\n      reaching for objects.\n    - Reflexes: 3+ throughout. Bilateral extensor plantar responses (Babinski\n      positive bilaterally).\n    - Coordination: Severely impaired (see motor exam).\n    - Involuntary movements: Multiple brief staring episodes observed during\n      the 20-minute visit (2 episodes, each approximately 10 seconds duration,\n      with behavioral arrest and subtle eyelid flutter, followed by brief\n      confusion). Myoclonic jerks observed in upper extremities (3 episodes \u2014\n      brief, bilateral, symmetric jerks of arms/shoulders).\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL ASSESSMENT:\nPer available records and observation, Eli is functioning at a significantly\nbelow age-level across all developmental domains. Estimated developmental\nage approximately 18-24 months for communication, <12 months for gross motor\n(non-ambulatory), approximately 12-18 months for fine motor, and approximately\n18-24 months for adaptive/self-care. He requires total assistance for all\nactivities of daily living (feeding, dressing, bathing, toileting).\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\nICD-10 Codes:\n  F84.0 \u2014 Autistic disorder (historical, per prior diagnosis)\n  G40.309 \u2014 Generalized idiopathic epilepsy, not intractable\n  R62.52 \u2014 Short stature (child)\n  R62.51 \u2014 Failure to thrive (child)\n  G80.9 \u2014 Cerebral palsy, unspecified (working dx for motor impairment)\n  M41.20 \u2014 Other idiopathic scoliosis, site unspecified\n  R47.1 \u2014 Dysarthria and anarthria\n\nASSESSMENT:\nComplex neurodevelopmental and neurological presentation in a 10-year-old male\nwith a history of autism spectrum disorder per prior evaluation, epilepsy\n(partially controlled on levetiracetam 500mg BID), progressive motor decline\nresulting in wheelchair dependence, and ongoing developmental regression across\nall domains. The degree of regression and progressive nature of this\npresentation is atypical for isolated autism spectrum disorder. The combination\nof progressive motor decline, seizures, possible visual concerns, and global\nregression raises concern for an underlying neurodegenerative or\nneurometabolic process. However, records are critically incomplete \u2014 key\nneurology records, imaging studies, EEG results, and laboratory data from the\nprior duty station were not included in the transfer packet.\n\nPLAN:\n1. URGENT neurology referral \u2014 submitted to TRICARE for pediatric neurology\n   at Womack Army Medical Center or community care network. Marked as urgent\n   given active seizure disorder with incomplete control and progressive\n   neurological decline.\n2. Request complete records from ALL prior providers:\n   a. Dr. James Whitfield, Pediatrics \u2014 Hampton, VA\n   b. Developmental pediatrics evaluation \u2014 Virginia (provider name unknown,\n      mother to provide)\n   c. Neurology \u2014 Virginia (provider name unknown)\n   d. Dr. Kevin Chen, Neurology \u2014 Columbus, GA / Nationwide Children's\n   e. Dr. Adwoa Osei, Neurology \u2014 Columbus, GA (PRIORITY \u2014 mother reports\n      this provider recommended genetic testing)\n   f. MRI facilities \u2014 Virginia and Georgia\n   g. EEG facility \u2014 Georgia\n3. Schedule extended follow-up visit in 4 weeks to review mother's personal\n   record binder and all incoming records.\n4. Continue current medications: levetiracetam 500mg BID, MiraLAX daily,\n   melatonin QHS PRN.\n5. Referral to Cumberland County Schools for IEP transfer and evaluation.\n6. PT/OT referrals for home-based services.\n7. If seizure frequency increases or any prolonged seizure (>2 minutes),\n   family instructed to call 911. Discussed rescue medication (diazepam\n   rectal gel) \u2014 will defer to neurology for this prescription.\n\nReturn in 4 weeks for record review, sooner PRN.\n\n_____________________________________________\nLisa Washington, MD\nHarnett Pediatrics \u2014 Fayetteville, NC\nElectronically signed: 06/18/2022 17:42 EST\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENCOUNTER NOTE \u2014 FOLLOW-UP / RECORDS REVIEW\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDate of Service: 12/15/2022\nPatient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS\nDOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 10 years 9 months | Sex: Male\nMRN: FV-2022-08841\nVisit Type: Follow-Up \u2014 Established Patient (30 min)\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:\nFollow-up. Review of additional records received. Ongoing seizure management.\n\nRECORDS UPDATE:\nSince the initial visit, the following additional records have been received:\n  RECEIVED:\n  - MRI brain report, age 6 (Riverside Radiology, Columbus, GA): \"Mildly\n    prominent ventricles, likely normal variant. No acute intracranial\n    pathology.\" No comparison to prior imaging was performed at that time.\n  - ABA therapy summary (Virginia, ages 4-6): Documents minimal progress,\n    notes \"difficulty with skill retention.\"\n  - Dr. James Whitfield (Virginia) \u2014 partial records, well-child visits only.\n    No developmental pediatrics referral letter or evaluation report included.\n  - IEP records from Georgia (2020-2022).\n\n  STILL NOT RECEIVED:\n  - MRI brain report, age 9 \u2014 requested twice from Piedmont Columbus Regional;\n    no response.\n  - EEG report, age 9 \u2014 requested from Columbus Neuroscience Associates.\n    Office states they are \"locating the file.\"\n  - Dr. Adwoa Osei neurology records \u2014 requested from Columbus Neuroscience\n    Associates. Same response as above.\n  - Laboratory results (metabolic studies, age 9) \u2014 NOT received.\n  - Virginia neurology and developmental pediatrics records \u2014 provider names\n    could not be confirmed from available documentation. Mother states the\n    developmental evaluation was performed at \"a clinic in Norfolk\" but does\n    not recall the specific provider name.\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY:\nMother reports that Eli's seizure activity has been relatively stable since\nthe last visit \u2014 approximately 3-5 observable staring episodes daily.\nNocturnal jerking continues 3-4 nights per week. No prolonged seizures. No\nER visits. Appetite remains poor. Constipation managed with MiraLAX. Mother\nreports that a neurologist in Ohio (Dr. Osei) recommended genetic testing but\nthis was never completed before the family's PCS. She states Dr. Osei\n\"finally said it wasn't just autism\" and wanted to pursue genetic workup, but\nthe family received PCS orders before this could be initiated.\n\nMother brought her personal record binder to this visit. I reviewed portions\nof it with her during the appointment. The binder contains handwritten notes,\nprinted lab results, therapy progress reports, school evaluations, and\nphotographs documenting Eli's functional decline over time. Mother's\ndocumentation is detailed and organized chronologically. Several items in the\nbinder are not present in any of the medical records we have received through\nofficial channels, including:\n  - A note from a physical therapist (Georgia, 2021) stating: \"This does not\n    look like typical ASD motor involvement. Recommend neurology re-evaluation\n    for possible neurodegenerative process.\"\n  - A handwritten note from mother documenting a conversation with Dr. Osei\n    in which genetic testing was recommended.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Neurology referral remains active \u2014 appointment not yet scheduled. Current\n   estimated wait is 4 months through TRICARE community care network. I will\n   request Womack AMC neurology directly as a military-dependent priority.\n2. Continue to pursue outstanding records. Third request sent to Columbus\n   Neuroscience Associates and Piedmont Columbus Regional.\n3. Continue levetiracetam 500mg BID.\n4. Follow-up at 11-year well-child visit.\n5. Mother counseled on seizure first aid and when to call 911.\n\n_____________________________________________\nLisa Washington, MD\nHarnett Pediatrics \u2014 Fayetteville, NC\nElectronically signed: 12/15/2022 16:28 EST\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENCOUNTER NOTE \u2014 11-YEAR WELL-CHILD VISIT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDate of Service: 03/20/2023\nPatient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS\nDOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 11 years 0 months | Sex: Male\nMRN: FV-2022-08841\nVisit Type: Well-Child / Preventive \u2014 Annual\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:\nAnnual well-child examination. Ongoing management of complex medical issues.\n\nVITALS:\n  Height: 54.8 inches (139.2 cm) \u2014 8th percentile for age (\u2193 from 10th)\n  Weight: 65 lbs (29.5 kg) \u2014 5th percentile for age (\u2193 from 8th)\n  BMI: 15.2 kg/m\u00b2 \u2014 12th percentile (\u2193 from 18th)\n  HR: 92 bpm | BP: 100/60 mmHg | Temp: 98.6\u00b0F | SpO2: 97% RA\n\nGROWTH TREND:\nHeight and weight percentiles continue to decline. Growth velocity has slowed\nsignificantly over the past 12 months. BMI percentile also declining. This\npattern is consistent with progressive nutritional compromise in the setting\nof neurological decline and feeding difficulties. Mother reports Eli eats\nonly soft/pureed foods now \u2014 he has difficulty with chewing and occasionally\ncoughs when drinking thin liquids.\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY:\nPer mother, Eli's condition has continued to decline over the past 3 months.\nSeizure frequency has increased. Mother reports Eli is now having 5-8\nobservable seizure episodes daily \u2014 mostly brief staring spells (5-15\nseconds) but also myoclonic jerks that are more frequent and more forceful\nthan previously. Nocturnal seizures occur several times per week \u2014 mother\nmonitors with a baby monitor and reports seeing rhythmic jerking episodes\nlasting 10-30 seconds during sleep.\n\nSpeech has further declined. Eli now uses only 3-4 recognizable words\n(\"mama,\" \"no,\" \"eat,\" and occasionally \"dada\"). He communicates primarily\nthrough gestures (reaching, pushing away) and vocalizations (crying,\nlaughing). Eye contact is rare.\n\nMother reports increasing difficulty with feeding, as noted above. Also\nreports Eli seems to startle easily and becomes distressed with bright lights\nor loud sounds.\n\nMother is frustrated that the neurology appointment has not yet been\nscheduled. She reports calling TRICARE twice and being told the referral is\n\"in process.\"\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n  General: Thin male, appears fatigued. Seated in wheelchair. Limited\n    spontaneous movement.\n  HEENT: Pupils reactive but sluggish. Difficulty tracking \u2014 does not\n    consistently follow objects across midline. Oral mucosa moist. Mild\n    drooling noted.\n  Neurological: As previously documented with the following changes:\n    - Verbal output further reduced (see above).\n    - Upper extremity ataxia appears worse \u2014 difficulty bringing hand to\n      mouth consistently.\n    - Myoclonic jerks more prominent \u2014 observed 4 episodes during visit.\n    - Two staring episodes observed during visit, each ~10 seconds.\n    - Increased lower extremity spasticity compared to prior exam.\n    - Ankle contractures progressing (now ~15 degrees bilaterally).\n  Remainder of exam: Stable from prior.\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS:\nTdap booster administered today (right deltoid). Mother declines HPV vaccine\nat this time \u2014 will revisit.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Epilepsy, worsening \u2014 seizure frequency increasing despite levetiracetam\n   500mg BID (current weight-based dose: 17 mg/kg/day, which is below\n   optimal range of 20-30 mg/kg/day for his weight). Dose adjustment\n   indicated.\n2. Progressive neurological decline \u2014 ongoing regression in motor, speech,\n   and likely visual domains.\n3. Failure to thrive / declining growth \u2014 nutritional concerns with emerging\n   dysphagia.\n4. Awaiting neurology evaluation \u2014 unacceptable delay.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Increase levetiracetam to 750mg PO BID (25 mg/kg/day) \u2014 discussed with\n   mother, she is agreeable. Prescription sent to Womack pharmacy.\n2. Neurology referral: I personally called the TRICARE referral management\n   center today and escalated this case. Also placed a direct referral to\n   Womack AMC pediatric neurology through the military system. Mother still\n   waiting for appointment \u2014 I impressed upon referral coordinator that this\n   is URGENT.\n3. Swallowing evaluation referral \u2014 speech-language pathology for modified\n   barium swallow study to assess aspiration risk.\n4. Nutritional supplementation: Recommended PediaSure 1.5 cal, 1-2 cans\n   daily to support caloric intake.\n5. Continue MiraLAX, melatonin.\n6. Follow-up in 3 months or sooner PRN.\n7. Seizure action plan reviewed with mother. Discussed obtaining diastat\n   (diazepam rectal gel) for seizure rescue \u2014 will defer to neurology but\n   if appointment not scheduled within 30 days, I will prescribe.\n\n_____________________________________________\nLisa Washington, MD\nHarnett Pediatrics \u2014 Fayetteville, NC\nElectronically signed: 03/20/2023 15:55 EST\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENCOUNTER NOTE \u2014 URGENT VISIT / POST-ER FOLLOW-UP\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDate of Service: 07/18/2023\nPatient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS\nDOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 11 years 4 months | Sex: Male\nMRN: FV-2022-08841\nVisit Type: Urgent \u2014 Same Day\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:\nFollow-up after ER visit on 07/16/2023 for prolonged seizure.\n\nER DOCUMENTATION (attached):\n\n  ====================================================================\n  CAPE FEAR VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER \u2014 EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT\n  1638 Owen Drive, Fayetteville, NC 28304\n  Date of Service: 07/16/2023\n  Patient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS | DOB: 03/15/2012\n  MRN: CFVMC-7829103 | Arrival: 14:22 | Disposition: 17:45\n\n  CHIEF COMPLAINT: Seizure, prolonged\n\n  HPI: 11-year-old male with history of epilepsy (on levetiracetam) and\n  ASD brought in by EMS after a seizure at home lasting approximately 3\n  minutes per mother's report.

WASHINGTON FOLLOW-UP NOTE:\n\nEli is seen today 2 days after his ER visit for a prolonged seizure. Mother\nreports Eli has been more fatigued than usual since the event. He has had his\ntypical staring spells (4-5 today per mother) but no further generalized\nseizures. She has the diastat at home now and reviewed the administration\ninstructions with me again today. She is confident she can administer it if\nneeded.\n\nMother is emotional today. She expressed frustration that Eli has been having\nseizures for over 2 years, is on medication, and yet has not been seen by a\nneurologist since their move to North Carolina. She stated: \"We have been\nhere over a year and he still hasn't seen a brain doctor. I keep telling\neveryone something is really wrong and nobody is listening.\"\n\nI share her frustration. Given the severity of this episode, I have contacted\nthe Womack AMC pediatric neurology clinic directly to confirm the expedited\nappointment arranged by the ER. I spoke with the scheduling coordinator who\nconfirmed an appointment with Dr. Samuel Park, Pediatric Neurology, for\n08/15/2023. I also sent a detailed referral letter summarizing Eli's complete\nhistory as known to me, the missing records, and the mother's observations.\n\nPLAN:\n1.

Height has dropped from 10th to\n5th percentile over 2 years. Weight now at 3rd percentile. BMI at 6th\npercentile. Growth failure in the context of progressive neurological disease\nand feeding difficulties. Modified barium swallow study (performed 01/2024)\nshowed mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with thin liquid penetration to the\nlevel of the laryngeal vestibule. Recommendation: nectar-thick liquids,\nsoft/pureed foods, upright positioning for all meals.\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY:\nEli was seen by Dr. Samuel Park (Pediatric Neurology, Womack AMC) in\nSeptember 2023. Per Dr. Park's report (received), extensive workup has been\ninitiated including MRI, prolonged EEG, ophthalmology evaluation, and\ngenetics referral. Mother reports Dr. Park believes Eli may have a\nneurodegenerative condition rather than (or in addition to) autism. She\nstates this was \"the first time a doctor looked at everything together.\"\n\nSince last visit, Eli's functional status has continued to decline. He is\nnow largely non-verbal. He communicates with gestures \u2014 reaching, pushing\naway \u2014 and occasional single words. \"Mama\" is the most consistently used.\nHe sometimes says \"no\" or makes vocalizations that mother interprets\ncontextually. He requires total care for all activities of daily living:\nfeeding (pureed foods, must be fed by caregiver), dressing, bathing,\ntoileting (in diapers), transfers (requires full lift from wheelchair).\n\nSeizures remain poorly controlled despite levetiracetam dose optimization\n(now 750mg BID). Dr. Park has added clobazam (Onfi) 5mg BID, which mother\nreports has reduced the frequency somewhat \u2014 from 5-8 daily to approximately\n3-5 daily. No further prolonged seizures since the July 2023 ER visit.\nNocturnal events continue.\n\nMother reports increased startle responses to sounds and light. She notes\nthat Eli seems to see less well \u2014 \"He doesn't reach for things unless they\nare right in front of him, and sometimes not even then.\" Ophthalmology\nevaluation has been completed (results to be reviewed with neurology).\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n  General: Thin adolescent male seated in wheelchair. Appears small for\n    stated age. Alert but minimally interactive. Occasional vocalization.\n    Drooling present.\n  HEENT: Mild facial hypotonia. Sluggish pupillary responses bilaterally.\n    Does not consistently track moving objects. Oropharynx moist, mild\n    pooling of secretions.\n  Cardiovascular: RRR, no murmurs.\n  Respiratory: Clear bilaterally. No increased work of breathing.\n  Abdomen: Soft, non-distended today. G-tube site \u2014 N/A (not placed).\n  Musculoskeletal: Progressive contractures \u2014 ankles now ~20 degrees\n    bilaterally, mild knee flexion contractures developing. Scoliosis\n    appears stable (monitored by ortho). Significant muscle wasting in\n    extremities and trunk.\n  Neurological:\n    - Verbal output: rare single words only (see above).\n    - No purposeful fine motor function \u2014 cannot grasp small objects. Can\n      perform gross reach with severe ataxia.\n    - Constant hand-wringing stereotypies persist.\n    - Myoclonic jerks: frequent (6 observed during 25-minute visit).\n    - Two staring episodes observed (~8 seconds and ~12 seconds).\n    - Spasticity increased in lower extremities.\n    - Bilateral Babinski positive (unchanged).\n  Skin: Mild pressure erythema over sacrum \u2014 discussed repositioning\n    schedule with mother.\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS: Up to date. HPV #1 deferred \u2014 discussed with mother, she\nwishes to wait given medical complexity.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Progressive neurodegenerative condition \u2014 under active workup with\n   Dr. Park (neurology) and pending genetics referral. Historical ASD\n   diagnosis is being formally reconsidered. The progressive trajectory\n   is not consistent with autism spectrum disorder.\n2. Epilepsy, refractory \u2014 partially improved with addition of clobazam.\n   Multiple seizure types (absence, myoclonic, and rare generalized\n   tonic-clonic).\n3. Growth failure \u2014 declining across all parameters. Nutritional\n   compromise secondary to dysphagia and progressive neurological decline.\n   May need gastrostomy tube in the future if oral intake continues to\n   decline.\n4. Dysphagia \u2014 managed with diet modification per SLP recommendations.\n5. Progressive contractures \u2014 PT ongoing.\n6. Caregiver stress \u2014 mother is sole daytime caregiver. Father's military\n   duties limit his availability.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Continue all current medications (levetiracetam 750mg BID, clobazam\n   5mg BID, MiraLAX, melatonin).\n2. Nutrition: Continue PediaSure 1.5 cal supplementation. Referral to\n   pediatric nutrition for caloric optimization. Discuss gastrostomy tube\n   with neurology and family if weight drops below 3rd percentile or if\n   aspiration risk worsens.\n3. I have printed ALL records from our system for the family to bring to\n   the genetics appointment. I have also asked mother to bring her\n   complete personal record binder. The neurology appointment scheduled\n   for next month \u2014 I will provide records directly to Dr. Park as well.\n4. Pressure injury prevention: Reviewed repositioning schedule (every 2\n   hours). Wheelchair cushion assessment with PT.\n5. Respite care referral through EFMP (Exceptional Family Member Program).\n6. Follow-up in 3 months or sooner PRN.\n\n_____________________________________________\nLisa Washington, MD\nHarnett Pediatrics \u2014 Fayetteville, NC\nElectronically signed: 03/18/2024 16:20 EST\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTELEPHONE ENCOUNTER\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDate of Service: 09/16/2024\nPatient: REEVES, ELI MARCUS\nDOB: 03/15/2012 | Age: 12 years 6 months | Sex: Male\nMRN: FV-2022-08841\nEncounter Type: Telephone \u2014 Mother (Denise Reeves)\nTime: 10:35 AM | Duration: 18 minutes\nStaff: Lisa Washington, MD\n\nCALL SUMMARY:\nMrs. Reeves called requesting copies of all medical records for a genetics\nreferral. She reports that Dr. Park (neurology) has referred Eli to the Duke\nGenetics Clinic for comprehensive genetic evaluation, including whole exome\nsequencing. However, the insurance company (TRICARE) has denied the genetic\ntesting panel, stating it is \"not medically necessary.\"\n\nMrs. Reeves is very frustrated. She states: \"They are telling me that testing\nto find out what is actually wrong with my son is not medically necessary. He\nis 12 years old. He can't walk, he can barely talk, he is having seizures\nevery day, and nobody knows WHY. How is it not necessary to find out why?\"\n\nShe reports that Dr. Park has already submitted an appeal letter. She is\nrequesting that I also provide a supporting letter documenting the medical\nnecessity of genetic testing from the primary care perspective.\n\nI told Mrs. Reeves that I will prepare and send a letter today. She is also\nrequesting a complete copy of Eli's records from our office to provide to\nthe genetics clinic.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN:\n1. Medical necessity letter prepared and signed (see attached). Letter\n   documents:\n   - 12-year history of progressive neurological decline\n   - Multiple seizure types refractory to medication\n   - Progressive cerebellar and cerebral atrophy on serial MRI\n   - Progressive visual loss with retinal degeneration\n   - Growth failure\n   - Unknown etiology despite extensive evaluation\n   - Recommendation from two specialists (neurology and pediatrics) that\n     genetic testing including whole exome sequencing is medically necessary\n     to identify the underlying diagnosis and guide management, including\n     identification of any available targeted therapies or clinical trials\n   - Reference to ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics) guidelines\n     supporting WES for undiagnosed neurodegenerative conditions\n\n2. Complete records from our office printed and prepared for family pickup.\n\n3. Letter faxed to TRICARE appeals department: (844) 555-0199.\n\n4. Copy of letter sent to Dr. Samuel Park, Womack AMC Neurology, and to\n   Duke Genetics Clinic (Dr. Rachel Kim) via fax.\n\n_____________________________________________\nLisa Washington, MD\nHarnett Pediatrics \u2014 Fayetteville, NC\nElectronically signed: 09/16/2024 11:15 EST\n\n\n================================================================================\nPROVIDER 10: DR.

Seizures partially controlled on Keppra. Recent ER\nvisit for prolonged seizure. Possible neurodegenerative process. Please\nevaluate and advise.\" \u2014 Dr. Lisa Washington, 07/18/2023.\n\nRECORDS REVIEWED:\nPrior to this evaluation, I reviewed the following:\n  1. Dr. Lisa Washington's referral letter and office records (06/2022 \u2014\n     07/2023)\n  2. Cape Fear Valley Medical Center ER record (07/16/2023)\n  3. Dr. Amy Huang (Columbus, GA) \u2014 progress notes 2020-2022 (partial)\n  4. MRI brain report, age 6 (Riverside Radiology, Columbus, GA)\n  5. Orthopedic records (Dr. Torres, Columbus)\n  6. Physical therapy records (Muscogee County, GA, and Cumberland County, NC)\n  7. IEP records (Georgia and North Carolina)\n\nRecords obtained via additional fax requests (received in poor quality):\n  8. Dr. Kevin Chen (neurology, Columbus, GA / Nationwide Children's) \u2014\n     1 visit note, partially legible. Documents MRI age 6 read as \"normal\n     variant,\" recommends continued ASD services. No genetic workup ordered.\n  9. Dr. Adwoa Osei (neurology, Columbus, GA) \u2014 2 visit notes, partially\n     legible. Fax quality poor \u2014 approximately 40% of text unreadable. What\n     is legible documents: EEG performed (results referenced but report not\n     included), MRI age 9 ordered (report referenced but not included),\n     \"[unreadable]...genetic workup recommended...CLN or mitochondrial\n     [unreadable]...family relocating...\"\n\nRECORDS NOT AVAILABLE despite multiple requests:\n  - EEG report (age 9) \u2014 original report not obtained\n  - MRI brain report (age 9) \u2014 original report not obtained\n  - Laboratory results including metabolic panel (age 9) \u2014 not obtained\n  - All Virginia records (ages 0-7) \u2014 not obtained\n  - Original developmental pediatrics evaluation (age 3.5) \u2014 not obtained\n\nMOTHER'S PERSONAL DOCUMENTATION:\nMrs. Denise Reeves brought a comprehensive personal binder to this\nappointment containing records, handwritten notes, photographs, and\nobservations spanning Eli's entire life. This is the first time I have been\nable to review records spanning the patient's entire developmental and\nmedical trajectory, thanks to the mother's personal documentation. I spent\napproximately 45 minutes reviewing this binder prior to examining the\npatient. Key items from the binder that are NOT available in any official\nmedical record transfer include:\n\n  a. Mother's handwritten developmental timeline documenting milestone\n     acquisition AND LOSS \u2014 with specific dates and examples\n  b. Photographs showing Eli walking independently (age 3-4), walking with\n     unsteady gait (age 6-7), using a walker (age 8), and in wheelchair\n     (age 9-present). The visual documentation of motor decline is striking.\n  c. Home video clips on mother's phone showing: staring episodes (age 4-5,\n     labeled by mother as \"the spells nobody believed me about\"), myoclonic\n     jerks during sleep (age 8), and a generalized seizure (age 10).\n  d. A note from a physical therapist in Georgia (2021): \"This does not look\n     like typical ASD motor involvement. Recommend neurology re-evaluation\n     for possible neurodegenerative process.\"\n  e. Mother's handwritten account of Dr. Osei's verbal recommendation for\n     genetic testing, with the specific note: \"Dr. Osei said this is NOT\n     autism. She said it's something else, something genetic. She wanted to\n     do testing but we got orders to move.\"\n  f. A printed screenshot of an online search result for \"autism regression\n     seizures cerebellar atrophy\" dated 2021, with mother's handwritten\n     annotation: \"Batten disease? \u2014 asked Dr. Huang, she said probably not\n     but to mention it to neurology.\"\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nEli is an 11-year-6-month-old mixed-race male referred for comprehensive\nneurological evaluation in the setting of a reportedly progressive\nneurodevelopmental condition historically attributed to autism spectrum\ndisorder.\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY (reconstructed from all available sources):\n\n  Birth \u2014 12 months: Unremarkable. Full-term, normal delivery, APGAR 8/9.\n  Appropriate early milestones \u2014 social smile at 6 weeks, sitting at 6\n  months, babbling by 8 months, first words at 12 months.\n\n  12 \u2014 24 months: First signs of concern. Vocabulary plateaued at\n  approximately 20 words by age 2. Walking achieved at 26 months (delayed).\n  Parents noted he was \"not keeping up\" with peers.\n\n  2 \u2014 4 years: Walked but unsteadily (toe-walking noted). Speech remained\n  limited to single words and 2-word phrases. Hand-wringing movements began.\n  Staring spells noted by parents \u2014 dismissed as \"daydreaming.\" Diagnosed\n  with ASD at age 3.5 based on limited speech, repetitive hand movements,\n  and social withdrawal.\n\n  4 \u2014 7 years: REGRESSION became apparent. Per mother, Eli could button his\n  shirt at age 4 but not at age 6. Walking became increasingly unsteady.\n  Speech regressed from short phrases to primarily single words. Staring\n  spells increased in frequency (15-30 seconds, with post-event confusion).\n  Night-time events described (waking, appearing frightened and disoriented).\n  MRI age 6: \"mildly prominent ventricles, normal variant.\" No metabolic or\n  genetic workup performed. Family moved from Virginia to Georgia.\n\n  7 \u2014 10 years: Accelerating decline. Required AFOs by age 8. Wheelchair by\n  age 9.5. Speech reduced to single words. Staring spells 2-3 per day.\n  Myoclonic jerks noted during sleep. EEG age 9 (report unavailable but\n  referenced in Dr. Osei's partially legible note): showed epileptiform\n  activity. MRI age 9 (report unavailable but referenced): reportedly showed\n  cerebellar atrophy. Basic labs reportedly included elevated lactate (per\n  mother's binder notes, though lab report not available). Dr. Osei\n  recommended genetic workup \u2014 not completed before PCS.\n\n  10 \u2014 present: Wheelchair dependent. Seizures multiple times daily despite\n  levetiracetam. Speech limited to 4-5 recognizable words. Prolonged seizure\n  requiring ER visit (07/2023). Visual concerns emerging. Growth declining.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n  1. Levetiracetam (Keppra) 750mg PO BID\n  2. Diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) 10mg PRN seizure >2 min\n  3. Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX) 8.5g PO daily\n  4. Melatonin 3mg PO QHS PRN\n\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:\n\n  Mental Status:\n  - Arousal: Alert, eyes open spontaneously.\n  - Attention: Inconsistent. Turns to name approximately 50% of the time.\n    Turns to loud sounds consistently.\n  - Language \u2014 Receptive: Follows simple one-step commands inconsistently\n    (\"give me your hand\" \u2014 complied 1 of 3 attempts). Does not follow\n    two-step commands. Appears to understand tone of voice (calm vs. urgent).\n  - Language \u2014 Expressive: Extremely limited. During the 60-minute\n    evaluation, the following verbalizations were noted: \"mama\" (x3), \"no\"\n    (x2), one episode of crying, and several non-specific vocalizations.\n    Mother reports \"eat\" and \"dada\" are also in his repertoire but were not\n    observed today.\n  - Affect: Flat affect for most of the exam. Brief smile when mother spoke\n    to him softly. Cried briefly during fundoscopic exam.\n\n  Cranial Nerves:\n  - CN I: Not tested.\n  - CN II: Visual acuity \u2014 unable to formally test. Does not reliably fixate\n    on small objects. Appears to perceive large, high-contrast objects within\n    approximately 12 inches. Does NOT consistently track moving objects\n    across midline. Blink to visual threat: inconsistent (present on left,\n    absent on right in 3 trials \u2014 may reflect visual field deficit vs.\n    inattention). CONCERN FOR PROGRESSIVE VISUAL LOSS.\n  - CN II \u2014 Fundoscopic exam: SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS. Optic discs appear pale\n    bilaterally \u2014 RIGHT more than LEFT. Disc margins distinct. Cup-to-disc\n    ratio 0.3 bilaterally. Subtle granular changes in macular region\n    bilaterally \u2014 difficult to fully characterize on bedside exam. POSSIBLE\n    OPTIC ATROPHY. URGENT OPHTHALMOLOGY REFERRAL INDICATED.\n  - CN III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements \u2014 full range but with saccadic\n    (jerky) pursuit. No nystagmus at rest. Gaze-evoked nystagmus present\n    on lateral gaze bilaterally. Pupils: 4mm bilaterally, reactive to light\n    but SLUGGISH (estimated 2+ bilaterally, should be 3-4+).\n  - CN V: Facial sensation intact to light touch (withdraws from stimulus).\n    Corneal reflex present bilaterally. Jaw strength \u2014 limited assessment,\n    appears weak (difficulty chewing per history).\n  - CN VII: Mild facial hypotonia. Symmetric at rest. Smile present but\n    weak. Drooling present (poor oral motor control).\n  - CN VIII: Turns to sound bilaterally. No formal audiometry \u2014 hearing\n    appears grossly intact.\n  - CN IX, X: Gag reflex present. Voice quality \u2014 wet/gurgly quality on the\n    few vocalizations observed. Consistent with oropharyngeal dysphagia.\n  - CN XI: Shoulder shrug \u2014 minimal, weak bilaterally.\n  - CN XII: Tongue \u2014 protrudes midline. Atrophic appearance. Fasciculations\n    not clearly observed.\n\n  Motor Examination:\n  - Bulk: Diffusely decreased. Significant muscle wasting in distal\n    extremities and trunk musculature. Upper arms relatively preserved.\n  - Tone: MIXED pattern.\n    * Upper extremities: Mildly increased tone with intermittent dystonic\n      posturing (wrist flexion, finger extension). Superimposed upon baseline\n      of mildly decreased truncal tone.\n    * Lower extremities: Significantly increased tone bilaterally. Spasticity\n      present (velocity-dependent) at knees and ankles. Ankle clonus: 4-5\n      beats bilaterally.\n  - Strength: Severely limited volitional movement.\n    * Upper extremities: Can reach for objects (antigravity), but movements\n      are grossly ataxic and weak. Grip strength markedly reduced \u2014 cannot\n      maintain grasp. Estimated 2-3/5 proximally, 1-2/5 distally.\n    * Lower extremities: No volitional movement against gravity. Trace\n      withdrawal to pain. Estimated 1/5 throughout.\n    * Trunk: Cannot sit unsupported. Requires full wheelchair support.\n  - Involuntary movements:\n    * Hand-wringing stereotypies: CONSTANT when hands are not engaged.\n      Bilateral, rhythmic, midline hand-wringing/washing movements. These\n      are notable for their persistence and automaticity.\n    * Myoclonic jerks: FREQUENT. During the 60-minute evaluation, I observed\n      12 distinct myoclonic events \u2014 bilateral, symmetric, brief (<0.5 sec)\n      jerks predominantly involving shoulders and arms. These occurred\n      irregularly, sometimes in clusters of 2-3.\n    * Dystonic posturing: Intermittent left wrist flexion/finger extension.\n\n  Cerebellar Examination:\n  - Severely impaired. Finger-to-object testing (using a toy): profound\n    intention tremor and past-pointing bilaterally. Dysmetria severe \u2014\n    consistently overshoots or undershoots target. These findings are\n    consistent with SEVERE CEREBELLAR DYSFUNCTION and are markedly worse\n    than would be expected from the available MRI report (age 6) which\n    described only \"mildly prominent ventricles.\"\n\n  Reflexes:\n  - Biceps: 3+ bilaterally\n  - Brachioradialis: 3+ bilaterally\n  - Triceps: 3+ bilaterally\n  - Patellar: 3+ bilaterally with crossed adductor response\n  - Achilles: 3+ bilaterally with sustained clonus (4-5 beats)\n  - Plantar response: EXTENSOR bilaterally (Babinski positive)\n  - Jaw jerk: 2+ (mildly brisk)\n\n  Sensation: Withdraws to pain in all four extremities. Light touch \u2014 less\n  reliable response, may reflect cognitive limitation rather than sensory\n  deficit. Proprioception \u2014 unable to test reliably.\n\n  Gait: Non-ambulatory. Unable to stand or bear weight.\n\n  SEIZURE ACTIVITY DURING EXAMINATION: Three clinical seizure events were\n  observed during the 60-minute evaluation:\n    Event 1 (09:35): Behavioral arrest lasting approximately 8 seconds.\n    Staring, subtle eyelid flutter, cessation of hand-wringing. Followed\n    by brief confusion (~5 seconds). Clinically consistent with absence\n    seizure.\n    Event 2 (09:48): Same as above, approximately 12 seconds duration.\n    Event 3 (10:02): Cluster of 4 myoclonic jerks over approximately 3\n    seconds, larger amplitude than the isolated myoclonic jerks observed\n    at other times. No behavioral arrest.\n\nADDITIONAL EVALUATION \u2014 REVIEW OF IMAGING AND RECORDS TIMELINE:\nI have spent approximately 2 hours reviewing all available records,\nmother's binder, and imaging. Based on this review, I have constructed\nthe following diagnostic timeline:\n\n  Age 3: MRI brain \u2014 \"normal for age\" (Virginia, report in binder)\n  Age 3.5: Diagnosed ASD \u2014 NO genetic testing, NO metabolic testing, NO EEG\n  Age 6: MRI brain \u2014 \"mildly prominent ventricles, normal variant\" \u2014 NOT\n    compared to age-3 MRI (different state, different system)\n  Age 6: Neurology (Dr. Chen) \u2014 single visit, accepted ASD diagnosis, no\n    further workup\n  Age 9: EEG \u2014 epileptiform activity (report not available, referenced)\n  Age 9: MRI brain \u2014 cerebellar atrophy (report not available, referenced)\n  Age 9: Labs \u2014 elevated lactate 2.8 mmol/L (per mother's notes, lab report\n    not available)\n  Age 9: Dr. Osei \u2014 recommended genetic workup \u2014 NOT COMPLETED (family PCS)\n  Age 10: Transfer to NC \u2014 records incomplete.
