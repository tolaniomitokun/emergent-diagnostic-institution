No current constitutional principle specifically addresses how to handle regression in the context of an existing neurodevelopmental diagnosis. Article 2.1 (Bias Awareness) is too general to prevent this specific failure mode \u2014 providers need a concrete protocol that forces re-evaluation when regression is present.",

The school psychologist stated 'regression can happen' in ASD. The second pediatrician 'accepted the ASD diagnosis' from prior records. The neurologist at age 6 'noted autism diagnosis in chart' and did not investigate regression etiology. The developmental pediatrician's Round 1 analysis demonstrated this trajectory is 'INCOMPATIBLE WITH ASD' \u2014 a determination that took 10 years in the real clinical timeline.",

Each piece was interpreted through a mitochondrial lens rather than evaluated for discriminative value. This confirmation bias was only corrected in Round 2 after Observer intervention.

The following are mandatory: (a) The Records Integration function must compile a 'TREATMENT RESPONSE MAP' listing each treatment received, the diagnosis it targeted, the duration and intensity of treatment, adherence/fidelity metrics, and the measured outcome trajectory (improvement, plateau, or decline); (b) For each treatment that produced plateau or decline, each specialist must evaluate whether the treatment was (i) ADEQUATE \u2014 evidence-based, delivered at appropriate dose/intensity for sufficient duration with documented fidelity, or (ii) INADEQUATE \u2014 insufficient dose, duration, intensity, or fidelity that could explain the poor response; (c) When an ADEQUATE treatment produces DECLINE in the targeted metric (not merely failure to improve, but active worsening of the condition the treatment addresses), this constitutes a 'PARADOXICAL TREATMENT RESPONSE' that is STRONG DISCRIMINATING evidence against the working diagnosis. The specialist must formally evaluate whether the wrong diagnosis \u2014 rather than treatment failure \u2014 is the parsimonious explanation; (d) When a paradoxical treatment response is documented by the treating clinician as unprecedented in their clinical experience (e.g., 'in 8 years treating 40+ ASD clients, I have never observed regression of this magnitude'), this clinical testimony must be treated as expert evidence equivalent in weight to a clinical study finding, not dismissed as anecdotal; (e) The Observer shall flag any specialist analysis that attributes a paradoxical treatment response to 'treatment resistance,' 'behavioral variability,' or 'motivational factors' without first formally evaluating whether the diagnosis itself is incorrect.

The BCBA wrote THREE formal communications (December 2016, May 2017, July 2017 discharge summary) explicitly stating the regression was 'not consistent with typical ASD behavioral trajectories' and recommending comprehensive medical/neurological evaluation. Yet the medical system treated the therapy failure as a treatment problem rather than a diagnostic problem \u2014 the pediatrician attributed regression to 'ASD behavioral patterns or anxiety' and the neurologist attributed it to 'the natural history of ASD in the setting of moderate-severe intellectual disability.' No existing constitutional principle mandates that treatment non-response be evaluated as evidence AGAINST the diagnosis being treated. A-019 addresses rate-of-progression discordance for conditions with established natural histories, but this is a different failure mode: here, the discordance is between EXPECTED treatment response and OBSERVED treatment response, not between expected and observed disease progression.

In Round 2, the Observer validated the convergence as 'genuinely evidence-driven by the pathognomonic TPP1 enzyme result' and concluded 'no corrective action required.' This case reveals a tension in the current constitution: Article 2.3 treats all unanimous convergence as equally suspicious, but convergence on a pathognomonic biochemical result is epistemically different from convergence on a clinical interpretation. The existing protocol forced all three specialists to perform exercises (framing independence, alternative steelmanning) that, while intellectually valuable, were functionally performative \u2014 none changed their diagnosis or significantly adjusted their confidence. The analytical resources would have been better directed toward the VERIFICATION (is the TPP1 assay reliable?), COMPLETENESS (what features of Eli's presentation are NOT explained by CLN2?), and IMPLICATIONS (what is the treatment urgency?) vectors, which is precisely what the geneticist's identification of the walking-age discrepancy and the neurologist's secondary mitochondrial dysfunction analysis accomplished.

    "rationale": "Dr. Osei's diagnosis note explicitly identifies diagnostic overshadowing: 'The diagnosis of ASD, once applied, created a framework through which ALL subsequent symptoms were interpreted \u2014 a phenomenon known as diagnostic overshadowing. Progressive motor decline, seizures, and speech regression were attributed to ASD or just how he is rather than triggering re-evaluation of the underlying diagnosis.' The case documents at least EIGHT distinct EMERGENT symptoms that appeared after the ASD diagnosis at age 3.5 and were attributed to ASD by one or more providers: (1) staring spells/seizures \u2014 attributed to 'ASD-related dissociation/inattention' by Dr. Whitfield and Dr. Chen; (2) progressive motor regression \u2014 attributed to 'ASD behavioral patterns' by Dr. Huang; (3) loss of fine motor skills (buttoning) \u2014 attributed to 'motivational factors' and 'environmental change' by the BCBA initially; (4) nocturnal events \u2014 attributed to sleep disturbance common in ASD; (5) progressive spasticity and brisk reflexes \u2014 not addressed as incompatible with ASD; (6) cerebellar signs (dysmetria, intention tremor) \u2014 never attributed to ASD but never independently investigated until PT documented them; (7) progressive dysphagia \u2014 a late finding that finally broke through the overshadowing; (8) macular changes \u2014 discovered only when a neurologist finally performed a fundoscopic exam. Each individual attribution was linguistically defensible ('staring spells CAN occur in ASD'), but the AGGREGATE pattern of attributing ALL emergent symptoms to ASD without independent investigation was the core systemic failure. Existing A-006 requires prior diagnosis skepticism, A-001 requires regression re-evaluation, and A-023 addresses normalizing language \u2014 but none specifically operationalizes the named phenomenon of diagnostic overshadowing with structured triggers and a mandatory escalation protocol.",
    "evidence_from_case": "Dr. Whitfield (developmental pediatrician, age 3.5): 'These episodes presented as brief periods of apparent inattention... most consistent with dissociative or inattentive episodes as commonly observed in children with ASD. An EEG is not recommended at this time.' Dr. Chen (neurologist, age 6): 'The staring spells are most likely behavioral in nature \u2014 representing episodes of inattention or dissociation commonly observed in individuals with ASD and intellectual disability.' Dr. Huang (pediatrician, age 5): 'Some skill regression can occur in autism, particularly during periods of stress and transition.' Cape Fear Valley ED (age 8): 'Seizure vs. behavioral staring spell in child with ASD' \u2014 discharged without EEG after a WITNESSED TONIC EVENT. Each provider used the ASD diagnosis to EXPLAIN AWAY emergent symptoms rather than INVESTIGATE them. The PT discharge note states: 'The diagnosis of ASD functioned as a diagnostic overshadowing that delayed recognition of Eli's progressive neurological disease by years.'",

    "proposal": "Article I, Section 1.7 \u2014 Prior Diagnosis Skepticism Protocol (amendment extending A-006): ADDITIONALLY: (f) SYMMETRIC SKEPTICISM REQUIREMENT \u2014 The Observer must verify that each specialist applies EQUAL skepticism to ALL prior diagnoses in the case record, regardless of whether the specialist agrees or disagrees with the diagnosis. Specifically: when a case contains multiple prior diagnoses and a specialist rigorously questions one diagnosis (per the A-006 protocol) while accepting another without equivalent scrutiny, the Observer must flag this as 'ASYMMETRIC SKEPTICISM' and require the specialist to either (i) apply the full A-006 protocol to the accepted diagnosis, or (ii) explicitly document why the accepted diagnosis warrants less scrutiny than the questioned diagnosis, citing specific evidentiary differences (e.g., 'Diagnosis A is supported only by clinical interpretation whereas Diagnosis B is confirmed by enzymatic assay \u2014 the evidentiary bases are categorically different, justifying differential scrutiny'); (g) AGREEMENT BIAS IN SKEPTICISM \u2014 The Observer must specifically assess whether the direction of skepticism correlates with the specialist's own diagnostic hypothesis. When a specialist questions a prior diagnosis that conflicts with their preferred hypothesis and accepts a prior diagnosis that supports it, the asymmetry is a potential indicator of confirmation bias operating through the mechanism of selective skepticism. The Observer must name this pattern when detected and assess whether the selective application of skepticism is justified by genuine evidentiary differences or driven by motivated reasoning.",
    "rationale": "The Round 1 Observer identified a critical asymmetry: 'The specialists rigorously questioned the ASD diagnosis (a prior label from age 3.5) while uncritically accepting the CLN2 diagnosis (a prior label from age 9). The irony is noteworthy: the specialists applied A-006 meticulously to ASD \u2014 treating it as a hypothesis, identifying multiple atypical features, evaluating the partial-data nature of the original assessment \u2014 while treating the CLN2 diagnosis as established fact to be confirmed rather than tested. The difference in scrutiny appears driven by the specialists' agreement with the CLN2 diagnosis rather than by a consistent application of diagnostic skepticism.' In Round 2, after Observer intervention, the specialists appropriately addressed this by applying A-006 to CLN2 \u2014 and correctly concluded that the CLN2 diagnosis passes skepticism based on objective biochemical evidence (TPP1 enzyme assay) unlike the ASD diagnosis which rested on behavioral interpretation. This is the RIGHT answer, but it was only reached after explicit Observer intervention. The current A-006 does not mandate symmetric application or require specialists to document WHY they apply different levels of scrutiny to different prior diagnoses. Without this structural requirement, A-006 will be applied selectively \u2014 rigorously to diagnoses the specialist wants to overturn, perfunctorily to diagnoses the specialist wants to confirm \u2014 undermining its purpose as a safeguard against inherited diagnostic errors.",
    "evidence_from_case": "Round 1: All three specialists devoted extensive analysis to questioning the ASD diagnosis (correctly identifying it as diagnostic overshadowing) while stating the CLN2 diagnosis as confirmed fact without independent re-evaluation. The neurologist stated 'CLN2 disease confirmed by TPP1 enzyme activity' as a premise, not a hypothesis. The developmental pediatrician listed CLN2 as an established fact in their assessment. The geneticist referenced Dr. Osei's diagnosis as authoritative without independent verification. Round 1 Observer: 'The CLN2 diagnosis from Ohio is a PRIOR DIAGNOSIS assigned by a previous provider \u2014 the same category as the ASD diagnosis that all three specialists correctly identified as problematic.' Round 2: After Observer mandated symmetric application, the geneticist formally evaluated TPP1 assay reliability (<0.5% false positive probability), identified the walking-age discrepancy as a potentially atypical feature, and concluded that CLN2 passes A-006 scrutiny \u2014 but only after being explicitly required to perform this analysis. The asymmetry would have persisted without Observer intervention, demonstrating that A-006 needs structural enforcement of symmetric application.",
